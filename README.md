## ü™ê Build Tiny Universes with Negotiated Trust

**Plantangenet** is a framework for creating **bounded, policy-enforced worlds** where sharing is *negotiated*, *partial*, *auditable*, and *ephemeral* as a core feature.

It gives developers, system architects, and world-builders the tools to model **trust**, and **privacy** as first-class system features.

If you'd like to dive into technical details right away, see the [Technical README](README-TECHNICAL.md).

---

## Why?

Modern systems often assume static permissions and all-or-nothing sharing.

**Plantangenet** flips that model:

- **Negotiated Disclosure**  
  *Define exactly what you share, with whom, and at what level of detail.*
- **Enforceable Policies**  
  *Machine-enforced rules for access, roles, and conditions.*
- **Ephemeral Memory**  
  *Attention-shaped, fading storage that models forgetting as a feature.*
- **Economic Incentives**  
  *Control retention and access with explicit costs (Dust).*

---

## Who Is It For?

- **Hackers** building strange, constrained, privacy-aware systems
- **CTOs** designing federated or zero-trust architectures
- **Game and economy designers** modeling negotiated trade and partial disclosure
- **Collaborative creators** who need nuanced sharing contracts

---

## What Can You Build?

- Private federated services with role-based views
- Multiplayer games with secret negotiation
- Attention-priced data markets
- Privacy-conscious simulations
- Collaborative apps with time-bounded sharing
- Distributed ML pipelines with native tensor support and GPU-accelerated data transformation

---

## Plantangenet isn‚Äôt just a library. It‚Äôs a philosophy of system design.

- *Boundaries are explicit.*
- *Trust is negotiated.*
- *Memory is shaped by attention.*
- *Privacy is enforced by policy.*

---

## Get Started

Plantangenet includes:

- Sessions with policy-bound lifecycle
- Agents modeling roles and permissions
- Cursors for fine-grained data focus
- Compositors for partial views
- Membry for attention-shaped, fading storage
- GPU-accelerated "shaders" for distributed data transformation
- Native tensor support for ML workloads
- Seamless integration with popular Python data tools like **NumPy** and **pandas**
- A pluggable Policy interface
- Economic incentives via Dust
- **Observables and Output:** Compositors and comdecs (loggers, dashboards, streamers) subscribe to session or agent state and update outputs in real time. This enables live dashboards, streaming, and pluggable output formats with minimal coupling.

---

## Observables and Output

Plantangenet uses an **observable pattern**: compositors and comdecs subscribe to session or agent state, and automatically update outputs (logs, dashboards, streams) when state changes. This enables real-time dashboards, live MJPEG streaming, and pluggable output formats with minimal coupling.

- **Agents** expose state and rendering methods (e.g. `get_widget`, `__render__`).
- **Compositors** (like dashboards) collect and arrange widgets from agents.
- **Observables** (comdecs, loggers, streamers) subscribe to state and update outputs in real time.
- **Session** coordinates all updates, policy checks, and output notifications.

## Status

Active, evolving, and open to collaboration.

## Support Development

Plantangenet is an independent, self-funded project. If you believe in building software that models trust, negotiation, and privacy as first-class features, please consider supporting development:

- **Emotional Support Tier ($5/mo):**  
  For those who want to see Plantangenet grow and receive regular updates. Your encouragement really matters.
- **On-Call Support Tier ($10,000/mo):**  
  For institutions or projects that want on-call help designing or deploying negotiated systems.

More support tiers are coming soon for individuals and teams seeking closer collaboration, early access to design discussions, or custom integrations. If you have ideas or needs, reach out!

## About the Author

Hi! I'm Scott Russell (Queuetue), a systems architect and AI specialist with over 25 years of experience designing, scaling, and leading technical teams.

I specialize in turning early-stage ideas into resilient, high-performing systems. My expertise lies at the intersection of **AI/ML**, **distributed systems**, and **data-intensive applications**. I have deep experience with simulation, agent-based modeling, **GPU-accelerated computing**, and building infrastructure for complex, decentralized workloads.

My work is informed by natural systems thinking: applying principles of feedback, resilience, and sustainable complexity to both software and organizations. I am passionate about building the next generation of privacy-aware, distributed systems. Yes, for interested parties, I do consulting jobs on the side.
