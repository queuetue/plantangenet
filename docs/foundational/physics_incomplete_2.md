### A Framework for Regenerative, Reference-Relative Computation

## Rethinking Computation from the Blue Dot

When this document was first written, Plantangenet was only a glimmer—an architectural hypothesis scribbled in the margins of time-bound systems. Now, with its initial release, I return to those early ideas from a new vantage. This is the “blue dot” in the title: not just the caprice of Sagan’s glorious stunt, but that small, strange pixel of perspective we gain when we step far enough back from our own assumptions.

What follows is a revision, a reintegration—a conversation between the self that first glimpsed the shape of disaxial computation, and the self who has now built part of it. We honor both. One dreamed, one delivered.

# Physics Incompleteness

What we’ve historically called *Turing Complete* can now be re-understood as **Physics Incomplete**. Not because Turing was wrong—but because he framed computation as a single-path traversal through time. His model, and the Euler–Von Neumann (E–V) systems derived from it, are **time-committed**, **axis-bound**, and **epistemically privileged** in a way that no longer suits our world.

The Turing machine is not a full description of computation. It is a subset: one that assumes a discrete timeline, a linear memory, and a committed causal thread. It is a brilliant map—but only for a very specific kind of territory.

## The Axis Problem

E–V systems constrain all meaningful computation to a **scalar moving through time**. Memory is addressed linearly. Causality is enforced by instruction order. State change requires a ticking clock.

This linearity has shaped everything—from our programming languages to our storage systems to our beliefs about reversibility and history. It is a metaphor mistaken for physics.

But time is not the only axis.

## Beyond Time: Multiaxial and Disaxial Frames

**Multiaxial computation** models multiple axes simultaneously—like spatial grids, sensor fusion matrices, or volumetric simulations. These models retain E–V principles at their core but scale them across domains.

They are **time-bound ensembles**, stitched together to simulate “more” of the world. But they still require synchronized clocks. Still privilege forward causality. Still commit to sequence.

**Disaxial computation**, by contrast, has no default axis.

A disaxial system treats scalar values as **latent** until interpreted. Time is one possible projection. So is policy. So is origin, privacy, identity, or imagined future.

The **reference frame** is no longer hard-coded—it is declared, negotiated, or inferred.

## Latent Fields and Regenerative Time

Plantangenet introduces a regenerable semantic substrate—**the latent field**—that holds not state but **possibility**. It is shaped by:

* **Past**: Traces, weights, and summaries from prior interaction.
* **Present**: Policy, trust boundaries, and live constraints.
* **Future**: Valid extrapolations and allowed mutations.

The system does not record every moment. It **reconstructs** them. In Plantangenet, `n-1` is as available as `n+1`. Memory is renewable. Time is a coordinate, not a river.

This enables:

* **Resilience**: Regenerate instead of retrieve.
* **Privacy**: Forget what no one paid to keep.
* **Perspective**: Share only what you meant to.
* **Truth as Framed**: All facts are shaped by policy and role.

Continuity is a view, not a fact. What appears stable is simply **consensual regeneration** within a negotiated frame.

## The Omni: Regenerator-in-Chief

The **Omni** is Plantangenet’s execution layer: a regenerable, composable substrate that acts as the shared source of reference-relative truth.

Its job is to:

* Maintain a latent field of structured potential.
* Accept vector-based **modifiers**—declarative edits to that field.
* Provide **composed frames** of reality to clients based on declared reference coordinates.

Rather than advancing time, the Omni **renders** time. It composes snapshots from the latent substrate according to policy, focus, and need.

Omni subclasses (like `GameTile`, `Spaceship`, or `Gravity`) aren’t objects in a simulation—they are **projection orchestrators**. Their behavior is to filter, coordinate, and present. They are not actors; they are **reference frames**.

## Compositors, Membry, and Regulated Attention

Raw AxisFrames arrive from domain-specific axes—position, force, identity, mood, etc.—and are assembled into MultiAxisFrames by the system’s **semantic compositor**.

* These composite frames represent short-term reality.
* They are optionally persisted, simplified, or erased by **Membry**, the attention-shaped memory substrate.
* What is kept, and at what fidelity, depends on **cursors**, **chems**, and **Dust**—the system’s attention economy.

Consumers declare interest via **cursors**, negotiate views via **chems**, and pay with **Dust** to extend memory or shape resolution. All memory is **selective, lossy, and policy-bound**.

## Modifier Chains, Refactored

Where early prototypes used the metaphor of **The Ocean**—a chain of modifiers in a fluid substrate—the modern architecture defines modifier chains as:

* Declarative transformation pipelines.
* Bound to reference frames.
* Executed as needed, not continuously.
* Stored as history if paid for; otherwise transient.

These pipelines interact with Membry and the latent field as composable components. Oceanic metaphors have been retired in favor of clarity and inspectability.

## Embedded Legacy: E–V as Guest

The Omni still includes a full E–V runtime. It manages:

* State persistence.
* Deterministic execution.
* Side-effect buffering and message routing.

But it is no longer the host. The E–V substrate exists **inside** the disaxial system, like mitochondria inside a cell. It is useful, familiar, and sometimes necessary—but no longer primary.

## Comparisons

Plantangenet’s architecture spans several well-known paradigms but is reducible to none:

* It mirrors ML latent space structures but is not a model.
* It functions like a game engine but without a global clock.
* It remembers like a simulation but forgets like a human.
* It shares data like a message bus, but governed by chems and policy.
* It projects like a renderer, but in policy-bound truth, not pixels.

It is best described as a **reference-relative regeneration engine**.

## Closing Frame

Plantangenet is not an operating system, a protocol, or a worldview. It is an **invitation to frame**, to negotiate what is seen, remembered, or acted upon.

Where the Turing machine says, “Given state and tape, do,”
Plantangenet asks, “Given policy and interest, what is worth showing?”

This is **Physics Incomplete**:
An architecture for systems where truth is framed, memory is earned, and time is one of many ways to see.
