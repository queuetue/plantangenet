## The Managed Async Debate Protocal

**Introduction:**
The concept of an Extended Debate Protocol presents an innovative approach to the traditional debate structure. This approach emphasizes deep, meaningful, and long-spanning discussions, allowing for a more thoughtful and reflective exchange of ideas. Central to this concept is the recognition and management of biases, advocacy positions, and the intricate dynamics of personal beliefs and evidences.

**Core Components of the Debate Protocol:**

1. **Start Phase:**
    - **Secret Keeper / Confessors**: Participants select a neutral party to confidentially manage biases and advocacies.
    - **Topic Selection**: A topic is chosen and recognized as an unproven claim under test.
    - **Initial Discussion**: An exploration of what the topic is not, followed by an agreement on non-relevant topics.

2. **Declare Biases Phase:**
    - Participants declare their advocacies or register them secretly with the Secret Keeper.
    - Presentation of unfounded and prefounded claims, accompanied by evidence.
    - Elimination of secret evidence and redeclaration of modified advocacies.

3. **Collation Phase:**
    - Registration, rejection, or acceptance of facts.
    - Introduction of special classes like Adjudicators, Investigators, and others, each with specific roles and biases, reflecting societal structures.

4. **New Claims Phase:**
    - Introduction of new claims and evidence.
    - All parties agree on the set of evidences and claims to be tested.

**Special Roles and Mechanisms:**

- **Secret Keeper**: A confidential intermediary for participants unwilling to publicly share biases.
- **Confessors**: A role for admitting changes in stance or withdrawing from the debate, akin to ringing a "washout" bell.
- **Special Classes**: Roles that mirror societal structures, each with unique functions in the debate process.

**Sanctuary (Formerly Archive):**
Completed debates are stored in a 'Sanctuary'. This is not just an archive but a living, evolving library of debates. It serves as a resource for prefounded claims and a space where debates can be reopened in light of new evidence.

**Philosophy and Approach:**
The Extended Debate Protocol is grounded in the belief that debates are not just about winning arguments but about fostering personal growth, understanding, and intellectual honesty. The Protocol challenges traditional debate structures by emphasizing the journey of discussion over fixed outcomes. It encourages participants to embrace and manage the complexities of biases and societal dynamics rather than denying them.

**Conclusion:**
This Extended Debate Protocol offers a nuanced, dynamic, and reflective approach to discussions, promoting a deeper understanding of topics and the evolving nature of knowledge. It is a step towards more meaningful, inclusive, and progressive debates, focusing on the long-term evolution of ideas and perspectives.

---
Debate phases and roles are described in the following sections.

Start
    All parties choose an accepted **Secret Keeper** / **Confessors**
    State **Topic** and accept **Topic** as unproven claim under test
    Wide discussion of what the **Topic** is not
    Agreement by all parties on what topics are not under test -> potential for return to start

Declare Biases
    Declare intended **advocacies** or register **Secret Advocacies** with a **Secret Keeper**
    Optional:
        Interrogate **Advocacies** with **Secret Keeper** -> potential for return to start
    Present **Unfounded Claims**
    Present **Prefounded Claims** _with Evidence_
    Identify and Eliminate **Secret Evidence**
    Optional:
        Dispute Evidence or Prefounded Claims Support -> potential for return to start
        Reject Unfounded Claims -> potential for return to start
    All claims accepted by all parties -> potential for return to start
    Redeclare modified **Advocacies**
    Optional:
        Interrogate **Advocacies** with **Secret Keeper** -> potential for return to start

Collation
    Fact Registration
    Fact Rejection or Acceptance
    Optional:
        Voting on Facts -> potential for return to start
        Vetoing Facts -> potential for return to start
        Adjudicator Classes -> A person whose opinion is elevated, allowed to apply guided judgement and personal bias to the process
        Investogator Classes -> A person who is permitted the use of violence to investigate and apply personal bias to the truth of a claim
        Legislative Classes -> A person who is permitted the use of obfuscation to disprove a claim, or who may create new prefounded claims
        Religious Classes -> A person who is permitted the use of claimed opinion to disprove a claim, or to create new prefounded claims
        Secret Keeper Classes -> A person who is permitted the use of secret knowledge to proxy acceptance for a claim.  Secret Keepers may be required to register their secret knowledge with any Confessors.
        Confessor Classes -> A person who is permitted the use of secret knowledge to proxy rejection for a claim

New Claims
    Present **New Claims** _without Evidence_
    Present **New Evidence**
    Present case for **New Claims** _with Evidence_
    Identify and Eliminate **Secret Evidence**
    Reject **New Claims** _without Evidence_ or _with Secret Evidence_ -> potential for return to start
    All parties must agree on the set of evidences and claims to be tested -> potential for return to start
    All parties must agree that the set of claims support acceptaince of the **Topic** -> potential for return to start
    Optional:
        Dispute Evidence or Prefounded Claims Support -> potential for return to start
        Reject Unfounded Claims -> potential for return to start
    All claims accepted by all parties -> potential for return to start
    Redeclare modified **Advocacies**

Sanctuary
    Completed debates are stored in a 'Sanctuary'. This is not just an archive but a living, evolving library of debates. It serves as a resource for prefounded claims and a space where debates can be reopened in light of new evidence.

**Plan for World (and Galactic) Domination via GesteuertesAsynchronesDebattenProtokoll (GADP)**

1. **Children's Book - "Pasteur's Underwater Adventure"**
   - Begin by shaping young minds with a tale of discovery, debate, and problem-solving. This book will serve as a primer for understanding the fundamentals of GADP in a fun, engaging way. Children everywhere will be debating the merits of plankton varieties before you know it.

2. **GesteuertesAsynchronesDebattenProtokoll - The Foundation**
   - Develop a detailed, comprehensive manual for GADP, outlining the process from inception to conclusion. This manual will be the blueprint for future applications of GADP in various fields, from social media to corporate structure and beyond. It's basically the rulebook for world domination, but don't write that on the cover.

3. **"Soshe" Social Media Platform**
   - Launch a social media platform based on GADP principles, where discussions are deep, meaningful, and structured. Debates on "Soshe" are long-form, meticulously managed, and lead to enlightenment rather than cat videos (though there will be a designated area for those too, because let's be real).

4. **Corporate Live Test**
   - Establish a corporation organized entirely along the lines of GADP. Every decision, from the color of the office walls to major financial ventures, is debated and decided through the GADP process. Efficiency might take a hit, but the snack choices will be thoroughly vetted.

5. **Minimal Viable Product: Small Nation Takeover**
   - Identify a small, underdeveloped power willing (or unknowingly ready) to be the testing ground for GADP governance. Implement the protocol at every level of government and society. Watch as this nation becomes a utopia or a really well-debated dystopia. Use this as a case study for scaling up.

6. **Galactic Conquest of Enlightenment**
   - With a successful nation running smoothly under GADP, it's time to go big. Launch a space program aimed at bringing GADP to the galaxy. Each planet becomes a node in an interstellar debate network. Galactic peace is achieved through structured, asynchronous debates, and the occasional space-based conference.

7. **Continued Evolution**
   - Never stop refining GADP. Adapt it for AI, inter-species communication, and whatever challenges the universe throws your way. Remember, the goal is universal enlightenment, one well-managed debate at a time.

Remember, with great power comes great responsibility... and the need for a really good debate structure.
