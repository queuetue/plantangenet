# Foundational Texts of Plantangenet

This directory houses the foundational writings of the Plantangenet system—four documents that span **narrative, theory, architecture, and method**. Together, they articulate the philosophy, origins, and scaffolding of a regenerable, reference-relative computation model. Each text offers a distinct lens into the system’s evolution.

For cross-context translation, see the [Rosetta Stone system](../stone/README.md), and the [Plantangenet Glossary](../stone/GLOSSARY.md).

These tools help decode terminology and bridge between perspectives—ideal for readers jumping between story, theory, and implementation.

## [Pasteur Book](pasteur.md)  
*A story of trust, perspective, and complexity—told through the eyes of a curious turtle.*

**Pasteur Book** is a children’s tale that gently introduces the core values of Plantangenet: curiosity, privacy, doubt, collaboration, and trust. Through a journey across the sea—meeting sharks, skates, and dolphin detectives—Pasteur learns to question, to seek help, and to frame what matters.

This is the **emotional Rosetta Stone** of Plantangenet: soft, allegorical, and accessible. It invites the reader into the system not through specs, but through story.

## [GADP – GesteuertesAsynchronesDebattenProtokoll](gadp.md)  
*A rigorous framework for structured, bias-aware debate.*

**GADP** proposes a managed, asynchronous debate protocol—built on roles, transparency, evolving evidence, and structural humility. It offers a governance and discourse model that recognizes human (and posthuman) limitations.

Originally envisioned as both a functional blueprint and a slightly tongue-in-cheek plan for **world and galactic debate domination**, GADP lays the groundwork for future Plantangenet-native decision systems, from corporate architecture to interstellar discourse networks.

## [Physics Incomplete v1](physics_incomplete_v1.md)  
*The raw hypothesis—time-bound notes from the system’s early edge.*

This is the **origin sketch**: a handwritten theory from when Plantangenet was still a glimmer. Here, the terms *Euler–Von Neumann systems*, *Multiaxial*, and *Disaxial* are born, wrapped in metaphor, drift, and unstructured insight.

Read it as a **fossilized moment in thought**—poetic, messy, and indispensable.

Crackpot scale: 3 (cite your research)

## [Physics Incomplete v2](physics_incomplete_v2.md)  
*The clarified theory—reframed, composed, and regenerable.*

This is the refined articulation of Plantangenet’s computational philosophy. It argues that Turing completeness describes a **physics-incomplete** model—bounded by time, linear memory, and enforced causality.

In contrast, Plantangenet’s architecture is:

- **Disaxial** (not bound to time as primary),
- **Latent** (possibility over fixed state),
- **Policy-shaped** (reference-relative), and
- **Regenerative** (memory is earned, not stored).

It introduces key components like **Omni**, **Membry**, **Cursors**, and **Dust**—framing a system that thinks more like a society than a script.

Crackpot scale: 2.5 (I built a reference version.)

## How to Read This Set

These texts are not in strict sequence, but are **meant to orbit each other**:

- Start with **[Pasteur Book](pasteur.md)** if you want heart and metaphor.
- Read **[GADP](gadp.md)** to understand the behavioral protocols that underpin Plantangenet’s governance.
- Begin with **[Physics Incomplete v2](physics_incomplete_v2.md)** if you seek a complete conceptual frame.
- Browse **[Physics Incomplete v1](physics_incomplete_v1.md)** if you want to witness the birth of ideas unfiltered.

Each is a different **projection** of the same latent field.

Welcome to the foundations of Plantangenet.

**A Note on the Crackpot Scale**  
Of course it’s unfair to rate your own crackpottery. I’ve tried to follow the lead of **[Ulillillia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-79yOZ13qg&pp=0gcJCcwJAYcqIYzv)** and anchor 2.0 as *“the concrete belief that physics is not local to our spacetime.”*
