**The Right to Expire**

We live in systems that don’t forget.

From web archives to infinite databases, from surveillance capitalism to blockchain ledgers, the assumption is permanence. That every action must be recorded. That truth must be immutable. That memory, if not perfect, should at least be total.

But permanence is not the same as justice.

Plantangenet began as a quiet rebellion. Not against structure, or logic, or computation - but against the idea that systems must last forever to be legitimate.

What if instead, we embraced expiration?

What if contracts could be ephemeral?
What if truth could be scoped?
What if trust could decay with grace?

The right to expire is the right to **contextual legitimacy**. To say: this happened, and mattered, and ended. To draw a boundary around time, intent, and memory. To let a system acknowledge its own mortality.

In Plantangenet, every Frame has a lifespan. Every contract has a pulse. Every piece of value is earned within a moment, not abstracted across decades. Dust is not eternal. It is earned, spent, and if unused, reclaimed or forgotten.

This is not forgetfulness. It is **designed impermanence**.

It allows for:

* Legal systems that do not record more than they need to.
* Games that last a night, but mean a lifetime.
* Collaborations that dissolve without shame.
* Experiments that can be wild precisely because they are bounded.

It protects participants from the tyranny of total memory.

It protects systems from ossifying into museums of their own past.

And it protects the future from being held hostage by a ledger no one can amend.

To expire is not to die.
To expire is to end with dignity, and to leave behind a footprint, not a chain.

This is the goal of Plantangenet.
Not that we last forever.
But that while we last, we are real.
And when we end, everything goes free.

Inspirations, but not blueprints:

* Buddhist impermanence, implemented as TTLs
* Elinor Ostrom’s local rulesets, made machine-executable.
* Frank Pasquale’s "right to be forgotten", made into default system behavior.
* Le Guin’s anarchist federations, with economic enforcement.
* Gibson’s fading cityscapes, now with garbage collection.
