# The Three Cheats: Axioms of the Plantangenet Dust System

## Overview

Plantangenet is not just a simulation layer or an economic substrate. It is an **epistemological intervention**: a principled refusal of modern assumptions about permanence, consensus, and truth.

At its core are **three foundational cheats** — deliberate departures from inherited dogma. These are not exploits. They are structural decisions that define the boundaries of what Plantangenet is *for*.

## 1. Causality is Protected

> Causality is not observed. It is enforced.

Causality is the only intentional scarcity in Plantangenet.

Where other systems rely on perfect logs or timestamped chains to infer truth, Plantangenet begins by declaring that **causality is a trust service**, not a fact of nature. It is secured by **intent** (e.g. signed actions) and **force** (e.g. policy enforcement and banker validation).

### Why Cheat Here?

Because in the absence of authoritative clocks and perfect memory, *trustworthy cause-and-effect must be explicitly constructed*. We do not infer; we **commit**.

This allows:

* Auditable actions without permanent logs.
* Declarative contracts instead of surveillance.
* Economic simulation without centralized control.

It is a refusal of the myth of automatic coherence. In its place: **intentional assertions and consequence tracking**.

## 2. Membry Degrades

> All memory is political. All persistence is negotiated.

Plantangenet does not treat memory as a neutral repository. Instead, it enforces a rule: **persistence must be earned**.

Membry, the memory subsystem, wraps all storage with **policy-aware logic** that enforces:

* **TTL and decay** by default
* **Dust-based cost** for precision and longevity
* **Trust-sensitive redaction and filtering**

### Why Cheat Here?

Because the permanence of digital memory is a **danger**, not a virtue. Infinite logs are tools of coercion and clutter. Plantangenet offers **designed impermanence**:

* To preserve privacy
* To encourage honest risk-taking
* To protect systems from ossifying into cathedrals of their own past

This cheat is not forgetfulness. It is **expiration as dignity**.

---

## 3. The Past is Regenerated Per Frame

> There is no single history. Only histories that hold together.

In Plantangenet, each Frame is not just the next state — it is a **recomposed moment**, consistent with prior causal declarations, but **recomputed** to suit the context, trust level, and focus of the observer.

There is no collapse of a universal truth. There is only **frame-scoped reality**, rebuilt on demand.

### Why Cheat Here?

Because the alternatives are worse:

* Freeze everything via global observation (quantum-style collapse)
* Require perfect shared state (impossible in distributed systems)
* Accept permanent contradiction (incoherence)

Instead, we choose **functional regeneration**:

* History is **re-expressed**, not retrieved
* Observers see **what they are permitted** to see
* Past and present are consistent, not universal

This is not a denial of truth. It is an embrace of **contextual coherence**.

## These Are Axioms, Not Bugs

Each cheat breaks a dominant assumption:

| Axiom                             | Refuses                                   | Grants                                     |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Causality is enforced**         | That time-order can be inferred from logs | Declarative simulation with auditability   |
| **Membry degrades**               | That storage is free and infinite         | Ephemeral, private, cost-aware memory      |
| **Past is regenerated per frame** | That truth is singular and must be stored | Contextual consistency across perspectives |

---

## Why Are Cheats Necessary?

Because systems that do not cheat must either:

1. **Pretend** the world is simple enough to model naively,
2. **Enforce** unbearable constraints (e.g. total memory, global consensus), or
3. **Collapse** under the weight of their own contradictions.

Plantangenet chooses a fourth path:

* Embrace bounded truth
* Construct scarcity deliberately
* Let memory expire with grace

These cheats are not limitations. They are **freedoms**. They allow Plantangenet to simulate, coordinate, and transact in a way that is human, ephemeral, and real.
