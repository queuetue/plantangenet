## [Oops, I Made a Money](OOPS_I_MADE_A_MONEY.md)

*A beat-poem confession on harm, memory, and monetary design.*

A personal reckoning with economic systems, coercion, and the need to build something better—even if it still stinks. A soft money, mortal and bounded. Regretful, but real.

Crackpot scale: 2.5

## [The Right to Expire](THE_RIGHT_TO_EXPIRE.md)

*A case for impermanence as dignity.*

Against systems that remember everything, this essay argues for contracts that die, truths that fade, and systems that let go. Memory by grace, not default.

Crackpot scale: 2

## [The Three Cheats](THREE_CHEATS.md)

*Foundational refusals baked into the system.*

1. Causality is enforced.
2. Memory is earned.
3. History is recomposed.

Together, these cheats let Plantangenet operate without surveillance, permanence, or global agreement. They are its epistemological spine.

## Reading Notes

These texts **loop, not ladder**—read any, in any order:

* **Oops** is the emotional core.
* **Expire** is the ethical one.
* **Cheats** is the structural break.

**A Note on the Crackpot Scale**  
Of course it’s unfair to rate your own crackpottery. I’ve tried to follow the lead of **[Ulillillia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-79yOZ13qg&pp=0gcJCcwJAYcqIYzv)** and anchor 2.0 as *“the concrete belief that physics is not local to our spacetime.”*
