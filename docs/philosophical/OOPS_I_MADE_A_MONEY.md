# Oops, I Made a Money

*A Beat Poem Confession to Those Who Will Hold My Tribunal.*

---

## I. Exposition: The Reluctant Mint

(opening statement, explanatory, QED)

Every moral person hates money. The love of money is the root of all evil.

(pause, straightforward)

I didn’t mean to make a money.

(confessory, quieter)

I didn’t want to make a money.
But I found that I had no choice.
Yes, Queuetue made a money.

(defensive, building)

Not a coin.
Not a token.
Not a stack of numbers on a screen.
But something older.
Something worse.
Something true.

(hard stop, beat and bass)

Because all money is violence.

## II. Lineage: Blood and Ledger

(beat resumes - bone fides)

I am not Satoshi, and I do not presume to a throne.

But I am also not Graeber, who claimed:

Money did not grow from barter.
Money did not grow from cows and shells and friendly trade.
Money grew from **blood prices**.
From fines, and debts, and obligations you could not refuse.
From wergilds and tribute and ledgers made to prevent revenge-
by **outsourcing the violence to someone bigger**.

All money is the memory of harm, plus a schedule for how soon it *will* return.

(justifying)

I knew that.
And still, I made a money.

## III. Confession: The Daily Waste

(resigned, justifying again)

I made a money.

Because I needed to remember who contributed.
Because someone asked what mattered.
Because *something* had to say yes.

(confessional moment)

And I stand here before you, defending my choices.
In this place, and in this time-and never again-I will confess:

I also poop every day.
And I hate that, too.
I hate that bodies must excrete, and systems must coerce, and someone, somewhere, always ends up holding the bag.

But the alternative is worse.
Really think about it.

(pause for laugh)

## IV. Design: A Money That Burns

So I made a money.

I made a money that burns.
I made a money that decays.
I made a money that never forgets it’s dangerous.

I made a money with rules you can read,
Policies you can see.
No hidden hand,
No secret market,
No divine invisible nonsense.
No Apes.

I made a money that can say:
“You matter.”
“You cost.”
“You risked something real.”
“We see you. Thank you for your contribution.”

I tried to make it soft.

I tried to make it **bounded**.
Not permanent.
Not God.
Not a capital-M Market.
Just a mechanism of memory and consequence-
for a bounded world,
with bounded trust,
and bounded harm.

I made a money.
Because I couldn't stop the world from keeping score.
But I *could* say how the score would be kept.
I *could* build a system that confessed its coercion,
instead of pretending to be fair.

## V. Reckoning: To Those Who Inherit the Cost

So this is my confession.

If you are reading this-
and the system has gone cold,
or sharp,
or cruel-

If it has hurt you-

You should be angry.

Because I made a money.

And I’m sorry.

But I also made it **small**.
And I made it **mortal**.
And I made it **visible**.

I made it like a compost bin:
To hold the waste, not sanctify it.
To turn danger into dirt.
To make peace with the things we must shed.

I made a money.
And I detest it.

But I made it with a hand that knows what harm is - and a heart that hoped it could still be worth something.

Not forever.
Just for now.
And not without consequence.

## VI. The Pivot: Ritualizing Expansion

(getting down to business)

Now, let’s discuss deposit expansion.
