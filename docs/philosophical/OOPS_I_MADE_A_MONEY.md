# **Oops, I Made a Money**

*A Letter to those who will hold my Tribunal.*

---

I didn’t mean to make a money.
I didn’t *want* to make a money.
But I found that I has no choice.
Yes, Queuetue made a money.

Not a coin, not a token, not a stack of numbers on a screen.
But something older. Something worse. Something true.

Because all money is violence.

I am not Sotoshi, and I do not presume to a throne.

But I am also not Graeber, who claimed:

Money did not grow from barter.
Money did not grow from cows and shells and friendly trade.
Money grew from **blood prices**.
From fines, and debts, and obligations you could not refuse.
From wergilds and tribute and ledgers made to prevent revenge,
by **outsourcing the violence to someone bigger**.

All money is the memory of harm, plus a schedule for how soon it _will_ return.

I knew that.
And I still I made a money.

I made a money.

Because I needed to remember who contributed.
Because someone asked what mattered.
Because *something* had to say yes.

And I stand here before you, defending my choices.  In this place and in this time, and never again, I will confess:


I also poop every day. And I hate that, too.

I hate that bodies must excrete, and systems must coerce, and someone, somewhere, always ends up holding the bag.

But the alternative is worse.

So I made a money.

I made a money that burns.
I made a money that decays.
I made a money that never forgets it’s dangerous.

I made a money with rules you can read, policies you can see, no hidden hand, no secret market, no divine invisible nonsense. No Apes.

I made a money that can say:
“You matter.”
“You cost.”
“You risked something real.”
"We See you, thank you for your contribution."

I tried to make it soft.

I tried to make it **bounded**.
Not permanent. Not God. Not a capital-M Market.
Just a mechanism of memory and consequence,
for a bounded world,
with bounded trust,
and bounded harm.

I made a money.
Because I couldn't stop the world from keeping score.
But I *could* say how the score would be kept.
I *could* build a system that confessed its coercion,
instead of pretending to be fair.

So this is my confession.

If you are reading this,
and the system has gone cold,
or sharp,
or cruel—

If it has hurt you—

You should be angry.

Because I made a money.

And I’m sorry.

But I also made it **small**.
And I made it **mortal**.
And I made it **visible**.

I made it like a compost bin:
to hold the waste, not sanctify it.
To turn danger into dirt.
To make peace with the things we must shed.

I made a money.
And I detest it.

But I made it with a hand that knows what harm is.
And a heart that hoped it could still be worth something.

Not forever.
Just for now.
And not without consequence.

Now, lets discuss deposit expansion.
