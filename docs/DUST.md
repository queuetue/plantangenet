## Dust: Computation as Currency

In Plantangenet, Dust represents the accountable measure of computational work, participation, and contribution within well-defined reference frames. It is not speculative or tradable in the conventional sense, but instead a policy-governed, negotiated measure of value. It is deeply integrated with Plantangenet's systems of policies, chems, semantic buffers, and reference frames to create a cohesive, transparent, and auditable economy for collaboration and infrastructure use.

### What Is a Reference Frame?

A **reference frame** is the boundary of trust and accountability. Each frame defines:

* **Policy**: The rules, contracts, and expectations governing behavior.
* **Initial Conditions**: Resources granted at launch, including capabilities, allocations, or entitlements.
* **Resolution**: The required precision and auditability of accounting for Dust generation and spending.
* **Reconciliation Artifacts**: Digital receipts - such as hashes, signatures, or event traces - which prove that value was generated within scope.

Dust exists **only inside the frame** that produces it. To leave or interoperate, Dust must pass through a conversion protocol that honors **both provenance and resolution**.

## Economics by Design

Plantangenet is not a marketplace. There is no trading floor. Instead, its economy is **declarative** and **computational**:

* Dust is generated by **doing work**: simulating, creating, facilitating, resolving.
* Systems accrue Dust by **providing utility**: uptime, coordination, hosting, contribution.
* Dust is distributed by **policy**: not profit motive, not supply/demand curves, but explicitly declared distribution logic.

This economy supports:

* **Transparent, audit-ready resource accounting.**
* **Non-extractive compensation** for artists, engineers, operators, and volunteers.
* **Emergent collaboration**, without the distortions of artificial scarcity or hype-driven speculation.

## Declarative Risk: Gambling Within Bounds

Plantangenet permits **gambling, speculation, and risk**, but only inside an acknowledged reference frame.

All risk must be **declared up front**:

* The actor must define how much Dust they are willing to lose.
* The frame must define how outcomes are determined and resolved.
* The system will enforce these boundaries; no hidden losses, no unbounded exposure.

This enables competitive, creative, or even chance-based interactions **without systemic fragility**. You can bet. You just have to say so - and how much you are risking to lose - at the beginning.

## Hosting and Participation

Dust is also how infrastructure is funded and accounted for.

* **Default hosting** options will accept Dust for compute, storage, and bandwidth.
* **Sponsorships** and **donations** can subsidize frames or users, providing access tiers.
* **No fiat pricing** is enforced; hosting cost is evaluated in Dust, based on actual load and systemic cost.

This allows:

* Free or low-cost access for experimental, educational, or collaborative projects.
* Fair pay for those who run systems, build tooling, or perform maintenance.
* Contribution-based sustainability instead of investor-based gatekeeping.

## Actor Disposition and Surplus Dust

Every actor in Plantangenet declares a **disposition** - what to do with unspent or surplus Dust.

* The disposition might **delegate** surplus to a parent agent, DAO, or pool.
* It might **tithe** a share to a foundation or contributor.
* It may simply **burn** unspent Dust, reducing inflation and signaling closure.

Dispositions are **inheritable**, **auditable**, and **modular**. They express *intent* and *alignment*, allowing Dust to reflect not just computation - but values.

## Profit Motive, Fees, and Distribution

Recent updates to Plantangenet's economic system introduce a flexible, auditable distribution mechanism for Dust. This enables:

- **Banker's Cut**: The Banker can automatically take a configurable fee ("cut") from any transaction, based on policy and identity class.
- **Agent Profit**: Agents can declare their own prices, charge clients, and retain profit (or loss) after paying actual API/system costs.
- **Custom Distributions**: Any surplus, profit, or unspent Dust can be distributed to multiple accounts, pools, or burned, according to explicit policy.

All distributions are:
- **Policy-driven**: Who gets what is determined by explicit, auditable rules.
- **Extensible**: New distribution types (e.g., tithes, DAOs, bonuses) can be added without changing core logic.
- **Auditable**: Every distribution is logged and can be traced in the transaction history.

This system supports both non-profit and profit-seeking agents, and enables collaborative, sustainable, and transparent economic flows within and across reference frames.

## Conclusion

Dust is not merely a meter or currency. It is **contextual value** - bounded by frames, distributed by policy, and owned through participation.

It is:

* Earned by doing work, or providing something with an agreed value
* Spent to unlock capacity.
* Tracked within boundaries.
* Governed by intent.

By tying economics to **computation, provenance, and declared policy**, Plantangenet offers a foundation for trustable collaboration - not just infrastructure.
