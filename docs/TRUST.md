# Trust, Legality, and System Integrity in Plantangenet

## Why Legal? Why Trust?

Plantangenet is more than a codebase - it's a framework for time-scoped collaboration, value exchange, and permissioned simulation. This document explores how its **frames** function as **computational contracts**, how **Dust** enables accountable value transfer, and how the system avoids exploitation through intentional constraints on visibility, duration, and access.

Whether you're designing a game, hosting a simulation, or operating a trust-limited economy, this is the legal substrate beneath your world.

## Frames as Deterministic Contracts

Each frame in Plantangenet defines a **computational contract**: a bounded environment with known rules, inputs, and outcomes. This includes:

- **Policy** – The enforceable rule set governing behavior, contribution, and allocation
- **Resolution** – The evidence and precision required for reconciliation
- **Initial Conditions** – Declared state at the start of the frame
- **Ledgered Output** – A deterministic record of state transitions, contributions, and results

This structure is designed to be **reconcilable in common commercial legal systems**, including arbitration and dispute resolution frameworks used in the U.S. and internationally. Each frame provides **auditable, cryptographic evidence** of who did what, under what policy, and with what result - a form of computational due process.

## Agent Behavior vs. System Integrity

The Plantangenet system is **deterministic and transparent**, but **agents are not**. People will lie, collude, launder Dust, or attempt to corner niche outcomes. This is expected.

To preserve systemic integrity:

- **Collusion resistance** is built into the salting, resolution, and policy layers
- Frame outputs are salted with **entropy** where useful, to resist predictability or exploit patterns
- **Policy engines may observe and counter-game** actors who appear to be manipulating frames unfairly
- Frames can **invalidate**, **rollback**, or **zero out** if emergent behaviors violate declared or implicit intent

## Upfront Risk, Not Undefined Risk

Plantangenet doesn’t stop you from gambling. It just asks that you declare how much you expect to lose. The system doesn’t judge your ambitions; it only insists that stakes are made visible, traceable, and contained. Want to run a chaotic experiment or let users mutate freely? Go for it - but define your blast radius. The economy of Dust, the bounds of a Uni, or your own policy envelope can all help signal intent before things go sideways.

Big, risky gambles might need the community to rally behind you. Collaboration isn’t just possible within Plantangenet’s policies - it’s encouraged.

## Legal, But Resistant

Plantangenet is **lawful in structure**, designed for:

- Deterministic and reproducible output
- Fully auditable state transitions
- Interoperability with contract-based, permissioned, and legal accountability systems

But it is also **resistant to speculative extraction and financial exploitation**:

- **Dust cannot be traded across frames without reconciliation**, preserving provenance
- **Reconciliation itself is part of the computational cost** and subject to policy
- **Speculative behavior is interpreted as a systemic risk**, not a success strategy

If necessary, **frames can self-destruct** or redirect their remaining Dust to maintain alignment with intent.

> **Summary:** You can use Plantangenet to build systems that hold up under audit, stand up in court, and resist abuse. The game is fair, but the system *will fight back* if you try to cheat.

## Ephemeral Justice, Not ACID

Plantangenet’s frames are **not databases** and do not promise ACID guarantees. Instead, they function more like **ephemeral computational covenants** - contracts that may exist only for milliseconds, if that’s what the policy allows.

This is **context-dependent legitimacy**:

- In a **musical improvisation frame**, a contract valid for **0.3 seconds** may be more than sufficient, encoding timing, agreement, contribution, and resolution, all within a rhythm.
- In a **financial arbitration frame**, such fleeting contracts would be unacceptable; longer lifespans, high-resolution trails, and durable storage would be required.
- The system allows for both: the **duration, durability, and resolution of trust** are part of the frame's **declared policy**, not a global expectation.

Plantangenet enables micro-contracts with ephemeral enforcement - justice that’s valid for as long as it needs to be, no longer.

Plantangenet is more like **a Snapchat-based small claims court** than a blockchain ledger. Contracts expire. Frames evaporate. And yet, they may still be legally sound, if you took a snapshot at the right time.

The Plantangenet economic substrate draws from traditions of time-scoped autonomy, transparent computation, and dispositional redistribution. It emphasizes context-limited enforcement, emergent agreement, and resistance to long-term extractive dynamics. These properties are not ideological; they are structural.

While frames are ephemeral and scoped, the system is not private, anonymous, or obfuscating by design. All computation is deterministic, audit trails are preserved at the resolution specified by the policy, and agents operate under the assumption of internal transparency.

If you are seeking to exploit this system to hide, launder, or erase information, you are misunderstanding both its structure and purpose. Traditional legal, ethical, and operational safeguards still apply and are your responsibility outside the system’s boundaries.

## No Omniscience: Agents Cannot See Policy or Logs

In most frames:

- **Agents cannot access their policy** directly
- **Agents cannot read or replay logs**
- **Agents cannot peer into the frame’s resolution criteria**

This is intentional.

Just as one cannot see the laws of physics from within a moment of time, **agents operate under constrained visibility**. If they could see across the boundary of the frame - into policy, resolution, or logs - they would be able to rob the system of causality:

- Preempt incentives
- Rehearse timing exploits
- Leak entropic salt into future decisions

This is how systems get robbed, and how causality, as a protective membrane, gets shredded.

Instead:

- Agents are bounded by **permitted interfaces**
- **Only the frame may replay itself**, and only under conditions defined by its resolution
- **Policy is enforced, not visible**

---

## The Frame Is the Law

Each frame **declares its own enforceable temporal scope**, policy, and trust window. If you stepped in, participated, and received Dust, that’s the extent of your claim. You don’t get to sue the ocean.

You can *join a frame*.
You can *earn Dust*.
You can *declare your disposition*.

But you **don’t get to ask for a refund after the tempo hits measure 3**.

## Glossary

- **Agent** – A participant in the system that performs actions and generates state within a frame
- **Causality** – The directional, traceable relationship between actions and outcomes within a frame
- **Disposition** – The declared preference or redistribution rule an agent chooses for its remaining Dust
- **Dust** – The internal accounting unit used to represent computational work, contribution, or reward within a frame
- **Entropy** – Randomness or salt introduced into a frame to prevent deterministic exploitation
- **Frame** – A bounded, deterministic simulation with defined policy, initial conditions, and output resolution
- **Ledgered Output** – The recorded result of a frame, representing all state transitions and agent contributions
- **Policy** – A ruleset defining what agents are allowed to do within the frame
- **Reconciliation** – The act of validating and integrating the result of a frame into another context
- **Resolution** – The granularity of evidence or detail required to validate frame results
- **Salting** – The act of adding randomness or unpredictability to prevent gaming the system
- **Snapshot-based Justice** – Temporal validity of a contract or agreement, potentially lasting milliseconds
- **Trust Window** – The time duration and scope within which interactions in a frame are considered legitimate

## Policies Control Membry Behavior

Policies in Plantangenet do not only define permissions and access, but also shape how memory (Membry) behaves inside frames. This includes defining degradation rules that are not purely time-based, but also business logic–based. Policies can enforce retention periods, resolution degradation, selective redaction, and detail masking according to declared business rules, privacy constraints, and regulatory requirements. This ensures that memory fading in Membry is not just a function of TTL but of policy-enforced workflows that can be negotiated, audited, and enforced as part of the frame’s contract.
