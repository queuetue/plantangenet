# Streamer / Live Creator Translation

This document is part of a Rosetta Stone for understanding the Plantangenet system.

## Dust

Plantangenet’s Dust system is a **planned, transparent credit system** that **puts you - the creator - in charge** of how your show is funded, run, and shared. It’s designed to ensure **every bit viewers spend is fully accounted for**, with no hidden cuts or losses, and that you get to **decide exactly how support is used** to make your stream possible.

At its core, Dust is **paid for in advance**. Before your stream even starts, viewers buy Dust to use on your content. This **sets a clear, fixed budget** for the entire session that *you can see ahead of time*. No surprise fees, no last-minute paywalls. If enough Dust isn’t committed up front, you’re free to **scale back the show, reduce production costs, or cancel altogether**. You’re never forced to deliver more than what people funded.

During the stream, viewers **spend** Dust on the interactions you design and price. Every sticker, emote, poll, sound effect, or tip has a **cost you set ahead of time**. Those prices aren’t arbitrary - they include everything it takes to run your show fairly: paying you, compensating your team, and covering platform or moderation costs that you *choose* to pay. Nothing is hidden or forced. You decide what’s worth charging for and how the money is split.

At the end of the stream, **all Dust is fully accounted for**. The system doesn't take some secret, flat “platform cut.” Instead, every single unit is divided exactly how you planned: your payout, your mod or artist’s share, infrastructure costs, or reserved for next time. Even tips and leftover balances aren’t lost - they follow rules you set, whether that means saving them for upgrades or paying you now.

The system **supports planned, policy-defined redistribution**. Viewers can tip you directly, donate to shared goals, or let leftover Dust flow back into reserve pools you manage. These are intentional, **visible tools** - not accidental leaks - so your community knows they’re supporting you in real, tangible ways.

Plantangenet also **encourages you to optimize** your show. By simplifying your production, lowering coordination overhead, or pricing interactions smartly, you can make sure more of what viewers give ends up going to you and your team. This isn’t about skimming off the top - it’s about helping you deliver better shows while keeping your funding fair and transparent.

Ultimately, Dust is a **framework** that gives you **real power and choice** over your funding. It sets clear rules for buying, spending, splitting, and sharing support so you, your viewers, and your team know **exactly where every credit goes**. No surprises. No hidden fees. Just a fair, flexible system designed to help you build the show you want - and get paid fairly for making it happen.

## What's a Rosetta Stone?

The Rosetta Stone was an ancient artifact inscribed with the same text in multiple scripts, which enabled scholars to decode Egyptian hieroglyphs by comparing translations. [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_Stone)

It shows the same system explained in different ways so that different kinds of people can understand it. Each version uses its own words and examples, but they all describe the same system: one with clear rules that makes sure nothing is lost or hidden. By reading these sections, everyone - designers, engineers, players, and organizers - can see how Dust works, how the rules are set, and how all the money or value is tracked and shared fairly.
