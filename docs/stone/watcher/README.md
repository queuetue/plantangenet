# Stream Watcher Translation

This document is part of a Rosetta Stone for understanding the Plantangenet system.

## Dust

Plantangenet’s Dust system is like a **closed, carefully planned credit system** that keeps streaming fun and fair. It makes sure that every bit viewers spend during a stream is accounted for, and that **everyone who helps make the show possible**--including the streamer, moderators, artists, and platform--gets their share. Nothing is lost or hidden along the way.

At its core, Dust is **bought up front** before the stream. Viewers decide how much they want to spend ahead of time, setting the **total budget** for that show or event. This way, there are no surprise charges or last-minute paywalls. The system knows exactly how much Dust is in play, so everything can be planned and tracked properly.

During the stream, viewers **spend** Dust to interact and have fun. Every action--like sending stickers, triggering on-screen effects, voting in polls, or tipping the streamer--is defined by **clear rules and costs** set ahead of time. These prices don’t just pay for the effect itself--they also help cover the work behind the scenes: coordination, moderation, and keeping the stream running smoothly.

When the stream ends, **all the Dust is accounted for**. Every bit viewers spent is either in the streamer’s pocket, split with the platform and team, used to pay for servers and moderation, or saved in the system’s reserves for future streams. Nothing just disappears. Even tips or leftover balances go exactly where the system says they will, helping fund the next show or improve the platform.

The system also **supports planned ways to share and redistribute Dust**. Viewers can choose to tip their favorite streamer, donate to shared goals, or just let small leftover amounts drift back into the system’s pool to support others. These aren’t accidents--they’re *planned*, fair ways to keep the community healthy and fun for everyone.

Plantangenet’s design also **encourages smart spending and better shows**. Streamers and their teams can plan more efficient setups that reduce costs and overhead, meaning more of your Dust goes to the things you care about: amazing content, fun interactions, and supporting creators you love.

Ultimately, Dust is a **framework** that makes sure your support is **visible, fair, and effective**. It sets clear rules for how credits are bought, spent, and shared so viewers, streamers, and everyone involved knows exactly where the money goes--and everyone can trust the system is fair.

> **Note:**
> This system is deliberately planned and fair.
>
> * Viewers buy Dust ahead of time so there are no surprises.
> * All spending options are clearly defined.
> * Nothing is lost or hidden--everything is tracked.
> * Prices include both fun effects and the real costs of running the stream.
> * Tips and leftovers are planned ways to support future shows.
> * Creators can improve efficiency to give viewers more for their Dust.
> * Everything is logged so people can see exactly how support is used.

## What's a Rosetta Stone?

The Rosetta Stone was an ancient artifact inscribed with the same text in multiple scripts, which enabled scholars to decode Egyptian hieroglyphs by comparing translations. (Wikipedia)

It shows the same system explained in different ways so that different kinds of people can understand it. Each version uses its own words and examples, but they all describe the same system: one with clear rules that makes sure nothing is lost or hidden. By reading these sections, everyone--designers, engineers, players, and organizers--can see how Dust works, how the rules are set, and how all the money or value is tracked and shared fairly.
