This document is part of a Rosetta Stone for understanding the Plantangenet system.

## Dust

Plantangenet’s Dust system is a **deliberately crafted frame** for making sure that what you give *cannot be ignored*. It exists so that **the value you create together can be seen, shared, trusted, and preserved**--not lost in noise or hidden behind empty promises.

At its heart, Dust is **honest**. It begins each cycle with a **pre-funded commitment**--real resources, offered up front, saying *we want this to happen*. Nothing is conjured from thin air, nothing is extracted on credit from the unpaid labor of the willing. It means that when you choose to bring your art, your skill, your time, your heart to the work, you know **the space has already been held for you**.

Dust is **bounded**. Its quantity for each cycle is known in advance. There is no hidden mint to print more when it's convenient, no silent drain to funnel it away. It is designed to protect *integrity*. It says: *this is what we have*, *this is what we share*, *let’s be clear-eyed and fair about how we use it*.

When you act within the system--writing, performing, building, teaching, coding, hosting, caring--you **spend** Dust, and you **earn** Dust. These transactions happen within **policy-defined spaces** that you help shape. Costs are not arbitrary: they reflect the true work involved, including the unseen labor of coordination, trust, verification, and making sure no one is exploited or left holding the bill.

At the end of each cycle, **all Dust is accounted for**. Nothing is hidden in the dark. Everyone can see what was given, what was taken, what was saved, what was shared. This transparency is *not bureaucracy for its own sake*, but a way to protect the promise that no one’s contribution can be erased, and no one’s trust can be betrayed.

Dust also **makes room for generosity**. The system supports planned, visible ways to give more freely: tipping, donating, volunteering your share to shared reserves. These acts are not leakage or loss but celebrated, tracked, and honored--so that generosity is protected from being quietly exploited, and so it can inspire others to follow.

Plantangenet’s design **welcomes craft**. When you find ways to work together better--to reduce waste, lower the friction of coordinating, simplify what used to be complicated--you **free more Dust** for the real work. Your insight, your design, your art make the whole community richer.

Ultimately, Dust is **not your master, but your steward**. It is the canvas, the stage, the ledger, the promise that what you do here is **visible, valued, shared, and safe**. It is the shared agreement that if we are going to build together, we will do so **honestly, fairly, and with the integrity worthy of the work itself**.

> This system is designed to be deliberate, honest, and clear.

> * The total Dust supply per cycle is pre-funded and fixed--so nothing is asked of you that wasn’t planned for.
> * All ways of spending and sharing are defined together, in policy.
> * Conservation is enforced--no untracked loss, no secret inflation.
> * Costs include all the work needed to hold the space safely and fairly.
> * Redistribution--tips, donations, drifts--is visible, planned, and celebrated.
> * Emergent efficiencies make more art possible without compromising fairness.
> * Audit logs ensure no contribution is hidden or erased.

## What's a Rosetta Stone?

The Rosetta Stone was an ancient artifact inscribed with the same text in multiple scripts, which enabled scholars to decode Egyptian hieroglyphs by comparing translations. (Wikipedia)

It shows the same system explained in different ways so that **everyone** can understand it. Each version uses its own words and examples, but they all describe the same system: one with clear rules that make sure nothing is lost or hidden.
