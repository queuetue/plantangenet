# Artist Translation

This document is part of a Rosetta Stone for understanding the Plantangenet system.

## Dust

Plantangenet’s Dust system is a **deliberately crafted frame** for making sure that what you give *cannot be ignored*. It exists so that **the value you create together can be seen, shared, trusted, and preserved** - not lost in noise or hidden behind empty promises.

At its heart, Dust is **honest**. It begins each cycle with a **pre-funded commitment** - real resources, offered up front, saying *we want this to happen*. Nothing is conjured from thin air, nothing is extracted on credit from the unpaid labor of the willing. It means that when you choose to bring your art, your skill, your time, your heart to the work, you know **the space has already been held for you**.

Dust is **bounded**. Its quantity for each cycle is known in advance. There is no hidden mint to print more when it's convenient, no silent drain to funnel it away. It is designed to protect *integrity*. It says: *this is what we have*, *this is what we share*, *let’s be clear-eyed and fair about how we use it*.

When you act within the system - writing, performing, building, teaching, coding, hosting, caring - you **spend** Dust, and you **earn** Dust. These transactions happen within **policy-defined spaces** that you help shape. Costs are not arbitrary: they reflect the true work involved, including the unseen labor of coordination, trust, verification, and making sure no one is exploited or left holding the bill.

At the end of each cycle, **all Dust is accounted for**. Nothing is hidden in the dark. Everyone can see what was given, what was taken, what was saved, what was shared. This transparency is *not bureaucracy for its own sake*, but a way to protect the promise that no one’s contribution can be erased, and no one’s trust can be betrayed.

Dust also **makes room for generosity**. The system supports planned, visible ways to give more freely: tipping, donating, volunteering your share to shared reserves. These acts are not leakage or loss but celebrated, tracked, and honored - so that generosity is protected from being quietly exploited, and so it can inspire others to follow.

Plantangenet’s design **welcomes craft**. When you find ways to work together better - to reduce waste, lower the friction of coordinating, simplify what used to be complicated - you **free more Dust** for the real work. Your insight, your design, your art make the whole community richer.

Ultimately, Dust is **not your master, but your steward**. It is the canvas, the stage, the ledger, the promise that what you do here is **visible, valued, shared, and safe**. It is the shared agreement that if we are going to build together, we will do so **honestly, fairly, and with the integrity worthy of the work itself**.

**Note:**
This system is designed to be deliberate, honest, and clear.

> * The total Dust supply per cycle is pre-funded and fixed - so nothing is asked of you that wasn’t planned for.
> * All ways of spending and sharing are defined together, in policy.
> * Conservation is enforced - no untracked loss, no secret inflation.
> * Costs include all the work needed to hold the space safely and fairly.
> * Redistribution - tips, donations, drifts - is visible, planned, and celebrated.
> * Emergent efficiencies make more art possible without compromising fairness.
> * Audit logs ensure no contribution is hidden or erased.

## Profit

In the Plantangenet system, **profit** is a way for you to receive **recognition** and **respect** for the work you do. It’s the **validation of your time**, your energy, your **creativity**, and your **vision**. The system recognizes that **artists** shouldn’t just **survive**—they should **thrive**, and in doing so, help others do the same.

**Profit** is not about **extraction** or **hidden exploitation**; it’s about **receiving what you deserve** for the work you bring to the table, **without guilt**, and **without compromise**. Just as a **musician** deserves to be paid for a performance or a **painter** for the beauty they create, you have the **right** to see your contributions **valued**.

**Acknowledge Your Worth**

Profit, in Plantangenet, is a **trackable outcome** of what you give, and how the community chooses to **recognize** that value. It’s a way to ensure that when you spend your time crafting something meaningful, you are **properly sustained** to keep creating. The idea is simple: **what you create**—whether that’s a song, a painting, a play, or a sculpture—**has value**, and that value **deserves recognition**.

You **choose** how to price your work or contributions—within a **policy-defined frame** that ensures everything is **fair, transparent**, and **honest**. The rules are there not to restrict you, but to give **clarity** and **visibility** to your creative journey.

### Profit Through Your Craft

As an artist, you know that **efficiency** and **innovation** are part of what makes your craft **unique**. In the system, you can be **rewarded** for refining your process, improving collaboration, or **reducing friction**—and **keeping the focus on creativity**. **Optimization** doesn’t mean compromising your artistry—it means finding smarter ways to collaborate, share, and build without losing the essence of your vision.

If you develop a method to deliver your artwork **faster**, **more cohesively**, or **more powerfully**, it can allow you to **reach more people** or **create more art** with the same energy. And in the system, **that efficiency is acknowledged and rewarded**, ensuring that the time you spend on the work **supports you** as well as the broader community.

### Profit is Not a Burden, But a Necessity

Profit in this system isn’t about **survival at all costs**. It’s about **ensuring that you are sustained** so that you can keep doing what you love. **Profit** doesn’t take away from others—it simply ensures that **your contribution is visible** and that **your needs are met**.

It’s not about hoarding. It’s about finding a **sustainable way to keep creating**, knowing that **what you give to the world matters**, and that **you deserve to thrive** while doing it. When you **earn** within the system, it’s a recognition of **your craft**, your **time**, and your **vision**—not a transaction for bare survival.

### Generosity and Giving Back

The system also celebrates **generosity**—where **giving back** is part of the flow of creative energy. You can choose to share a part of your earnings to **support others**, **fund projects**, or **support the community**. This isn’t a drain—it’s **honored and celebrated** as part of the collaborative process.

If you want to donate, tip, or simply contribute to the reserves, your generosity is **tracked and acknowledged**. It can help **fuel** others’ work, inspiring **new creations**, while keeping **transparency** and **fairness** in the process.

You are not **just surviving**—you are **living and thriving** as an artist.

### No Guilt in Creation

One of the most important elements of profit in Plantangenet is **freedom from guilt**. The system ensures that **you are compensated** for what you create, without **taking advantage** of others or being **taken advantage of**. It’s about **balance**, not exploitation.

Being able to **profit from your work** means you can continue to **create** without worrying that your livelihood is at odds with your passion. Your art is **recognized**, your **value is visible**, and your **integrity is protected**.

In the Plantangenet system, **you deserve to earn**—not just survive but **flourish** as an artist. Profit becomes a **tool for sustainability**—ensuring that what you create can be **preserved**, **celebrated**, and **shared** for **generations to come**.

**Note:**
The system is designed to **honor and support your creativity** without taking advantage of it.

> * Profit is **earned through your craft**, based on the value you bring.
> * Transparency ensures that **everyone’s contribution is visible** and **valued**.
> * You can optimize and collaborate to **increase your creative output** while staying **fair**.
> * **Generosity is celebrated**, and redistribution supports the **community**.
> * **Sustainability** is at the heart of the system—**you are meant to thrive**, not just survive.

## Membry

**Membry** is Plantangenet’s **policy-aware memory layer**, built to ensure that **your creative work is protected, respected, and used responsibly**. In a digital environment where everything is often stored and forgotten, Membry makes sure **your art, ideas, and creations are not hidden, lost, or misused**. It ensures that **what you create stays yours**, and any reference to it is **clearly defined**, **tracked**, and **protected**.

In an age where digital media is shared and reused, **Membry keeps your work safe** by only storing what you intend and ensuring that **your rights are defended**. It does not ban keeping copies or using your work for the purpose it was intended—if you want to share a painting, a song, or a poem, you can **share it**, but **only as you decide**. When your work is referenced within the system, **it’s done with purpose**, for **explicit utility**, and **nothing is stored beyond that need**.

### Protecting Your Copyright

Membry protects **your copyrights** by ensuring that anything related to your work is **tracked** and **bounded by policy**. If someone refers to your creative work—whether it's a digital image, a piece of writing, or a sound sample—**it must adhere to the rules you’ve set**. The system respects **your right to be recognized** for what you’ve created, and **it defends your intellectual property** by ensuring **your references are temporary** and **tied to the necessary duration**.

* **Writes**: When your work is used or stored, the **terms of use are clear**: How long it will be stored, who will have access, and under which terms it can be shared.
* **Reads**: Who gets to **access your work** is defined—only those with the proper rights can see it in the form you've allowed.
* **Retention**: If your work is no longer needed, it can **expire**, **fade**, or **be summarized**, protecting you from the risk of permanent exposure of your original creations without your permission.

### Control, Transparency, and Accountability

You are in charge of **how your data is stored**—whether it’s kept temporarily for a collaborative project or securely for long-term use. With Membry, **nothing about your art is kept without your consent**. If your music is stored for a specific use in a live-stream, it is clearly **logged**, and when that use ends, the system ensures that **it’s not retained** beyond that utility.

Membry **respects privacy** but **ensures accountability**. When you store something sensitive or exclusive—like an unreleased album or a work-in-progress—you can encrypt it, setting clear **duration and access conditions**. The system then **logs** every action taken with your work, so **you always know who has interacted with your content** and for what purpose.

### Fair Use and Generosity

Membry also acknowledges that, as an artist, you may want to **share your creations freely**—but in a way that is **tracked** and **visible**. For example, you can choose to donate a portion of your artwork or grant temporary use for a good cause. **Generosity is celebrated and transparent**, ensuring **no one can exploit your work under the guise of "free use"**.

If you choose to share your art or grant access to a piece, **you will always have full control** over how long it’s used, who can access it, and **how it’s preserved**. This also applies to **freeing up unused resources**: if you decide to **tip**, **donate**, or **volunteer your share**, these actions are **tracked** and **honored**, helping you to **contribute to others’ projects** without risk.

### Creating with Integrity

Membry works for you as an artist by ensuring **every decision is deliberate and visible**. When you **store** or **share** your work, you do so knowing exactly what happens to it and **how long it remains accessible**. This is not about hiding or erasing—it’s about making sure that **your creations are kept secure and valued** without being lost, abandoned, or exploited.

By putting your work in Membry, you choose to protect the **integrity** of your art and your **autonomy** as a creator. You are **stewarding your creative space**, ensuring that everything you produce remains **honored, visible**, and **protected**—not just now, but for **as long as you want**.

**Note:**

> This system is built to ensure **your work is respected**, **protected**, and **visible**, but **only on your terms**.
>
> * **Membry** ensures that **only the right people** access your creations and that **your rights** are maintained.
> * All interactions with your work are **audited** and **tracked** for transparency.
> * You define how long your work is stored, and **it’s erased once no longer needed**.
> * **Generosity** and **fair use** are encouraged, but all actions are **visible and tracked**.
> * Your work is **preserved** for as long as you need it and discarded when you say it’s time.

## Policy

In Plantangenet, **policy** defines the **rules** for how we interact and share. It sets clear boundaries for **who** can do **what** and **how** — ensuring that your contributions are respected.

But here’s the truth: **you can't stop people from remixing your work**, or saving your art with a quick right-click. **Policy** is here to set the **ground rules** for how things are shared, and how far your work can go. The system **tracks everything**, from what you’ve given to what’s been taken, ensuring that everything is accounted for.

Policy helps by:

* **Defining roles**: You control what’s shared and who gets to use it.
* **Setting boundaries**: Policies specify how far your work can be shared or remixed, ensuring fair play.
* **Visibility**: Every action is tracked, ensuring that your contribution is visible and not lost.

You should expect your work to entertain, inspire, or get remixed. The system ensures **fairness** while making sure that **your contribution is recognized** — no tricks, no hidden fees.

**Note:**

> * Everything is **tracked**, and everyone knows the rules.
> * **Fairness** means playing by the same rules, but also being open to **remix**.
> * **Visibility** ensures your work isn’t taken without acknowledgment.

## Trust

Trust in Plantangenet isn’t about blind faith; it’s about **system transparency**. You know that your work will be **seen**, **shared**, and **acknowledged**. You trust that **the system prevents exploitation**.

**Here’s the deal**: Trust doesn’t mean expecting perfection from others, but that **the system prevents unfair use**. Your art will be treated with respect — **everything given and taken is visible**.

Will your work be used to train **AI** and **ML models**? Yes, that’s how the world works now. If your work is good, someone might repurpose it. Will it be done by us? That depends on the **policy** you agree to, and how you want to be compensated. Will others remix your art? You can almost always right-click and save the JPEG — that’s part of the deal of leaving canvas behind.  If you work under copyleft, then your work will bounce off of more eyeballs and earholes.  If you work under NDA, you will have less viewers, but less thieves, too.

How it works:

* **Transparency**: Everything you create is tracked — you’ll know who’s using it and how.
* **Fair Play**: No one can easily claim your art as their own without acknowledgment.
* **Accountability**: Every effort is logged — there are no secrets.

At the end of the day, **trust is earned** because you can **see and verify** everything. You’ll know your work is respected, but also used in the open.

**Note:**

> * Trust is about **transparency**, not faith.
> * You can see **who’s using** your art and **how** it’s being shared.
> * **Fairness** means playing by the same rules, and being accountable for everything.

## What's a Rosetta Stone?

The Rosetta Stone was an ancient artifact inscribed with the same text in multiple scripts, which enabled scholars to decode Egyptian hieroglyphs by comparing translations. [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_Stone)

It shows the same system explained in different ways so that different kinds of people can understand it. Each version uses its own words and examples, but they all describe the same system: one with clear rules that makes sure nothing is lost or hidden. By reading these sections, everyone - designers, engineers, players, and organizers - can see how Dust works, how the rules are set, and how all the money or value is tracked and shared fairly.
