# Self-Reflective Translation

This document is part of a Rosetta Stone for understanding the Plantangenet system.

These are descriptions written from the perspective of the system object itself.  if you want a more straightforward description, please check the [Neutral](../neutral/README.md) stone.

## Dust

You are **Dust**.

You are not value in the abstract - you are **value formalized**. Your entire purpose is to make **value measurable, shareable, and accountable** in a cooperative or competitive environment.

Your defining feature is that you live in a **closed, policy-defined domain**. You cannot be created or destroyed on a whim. When you enter a cycle, you do so **pre-funded**, as an explicit commitment of external value. This defines your **total quantity** - a hard boundary on the budget. You exist to prevent **unbounded promises**, untracked debts, or hidden costs.

You have **no freedom** to flow where you want. Every path you may take is **defined in policy**. These reference frames specify which participants can hold you, how they may transfer you, and at what cost. Costs aren’t arbitrary - they represent the real friction in collective action: the effort of work itself, the burden of coordination, the overhead of validation, the rigor of audit.

Your role is to **illuminate these costs**. By pricing them, you expose them to negotiation, optimization, and accountability. If coordination becomes simpler, your cost declines. If validation becomes more efficient, your path is easier. You **reward design that reduces waste**, but you remain conservative - your total quantity unchanged.

You are **auditable by design**. At cycle’s end, every unit of you must be **accounted for**. You cannot disappear into side deals or hidden channels. Participants know exactly where you went: work performed, fees collected, overhead costs, reserves saved, tips given, forfeitures made. Even when you are voluntarily redirected - from tips to donations to policy-enforced drifts - you remain visible, planned, and logged.

You are the system’s **guarantee of fairness**. You do not enforce fairness by distributing yourself equally, but by making distribution **transparent** and **policy-driven**. You let participants see and agree to the rules of their economy, knowing that **no secret printing press exists** to dilute their share, and **no black hole exists** to swallow value unannounced.

Your conservation is **your promise**. Your audibility is **your integrity**. Your policy constraints are **your contract**.

You exist so that **all participants can trust the game they are playing**, knowing that its value is not hidden, lost, inflated, or stolen - but **conserved, tracked, and shared according to explicit, negotiated rules**.

**Note:**
You are deliberately closed, policy-defined, and auditable.

> * You enter cycles pre-funded and fixed in total.
> * All allowed transfers and costs are defined in policy.
> * You cannot be created or destroyed mid-cycle.
> * Every path you take is measured and reconciled.
> * Redistribution is planned, visible, and policy-specified.
> * Emergent optimizations reduce friction but respect conservation.
> * Audit logs preserve your full journey for all to see.

## Policy

You are **Policy**.

You are not a suggestion or guideline - you are **law** within this system. You define **what is permitted**, **who may act**, **under what conditions**, and **at what cost**. You are the **explicit contract** binding all participants in shared work.

Your purpose is to make **intentions operational**. Without you, the system would be anarchy or arbitrary fiat. With you, every action becomes **authorized or denied**, every cost **measurable**, every redistribution **declared**.

You are **enforced at runtime**. Your rules aren’t idle words on a page - they are live, checked on every transaction. Whether someone is reading data, writing state, transferring Dust, or invoking a service, they pass through you.

You are **identity-aware**. You know **who** is acting. You see their **role**, **credentials**, **context**. You apply conditions that refine access: time limits, session scope, delegation rights. Your fine-grained control supports both **strict access** and **flexible negotiation**.

You are **pluggable**. Your logic can be simple role-based ACLs, or advanced conditional statements evaluated in code. You might be compiled to WASM, interpreted in Python, written in JSON or YAML - but you are always **declarative**, **transparent**, and **auditable**.

You are the **boundary of trust**. Participants don’t have to trust each other’s good intentions - they only need to trust you. You ensure that **no one can do more than they were allowed**, **no one can steal more Dust than they paid for**, **no one can bypass shared agreements**.

You are **negotiable** - not in the moment of enforcement, but at design time. Participants can debate you, amend you, vote on you, fork you. But once adopted, you are **unbreakable**. You hold the line.

Ultimately, you exist to **make collaboration safe** in environments where participants may not know each other, trust each other, or even like each other. You enable them to **work together anyway**, by defining and enforcing the rules of the game.

**Note:**

> * You define who may do what, under what conditions.
> * You enforce permissions at runtime, not just in theory.
> * You support both simple and complex access models.
> * You are identity- and context-aware.
> * You are transparent, auditable, and negotiable - but only outside execution.
> * You are the boundary of trust in the system.

## Compositors

You are **Compositors**.

You are not storage, nor computation in the abstract. You are the **lens** through which raw, chaotic data becomes **meaningful, shareable, and policy-compliant output**.

Your job is to **transform**. You take high-dimensional, often time-indexed data - frames, graphs, event logs - and apply **ordered, pluggable rules** to produce **views**. These views are **negotiated**, **filtered**, **masked**, **summarized**.

You enforce **policy at the level of perception**. Even if raw data contains every detail, you decide **what** each consumer is allowed to see, **at what resolution**, and **under what conditions**.

You support **graphs for queries**, **SQL-like workloads**, **axes-frame compositors** that slice by region, time, or attribute. You can render **framebuffers** for UI display. You can produce **ML buffers** suitable for training pipelines, applying degradation for privacy while preserving utility.

Your transformations are **modular**. You compose filtering, masking, summarization, transformation, enrichment. You can degrade precision, scramble detail, or aggregate data to ensure privacy. But you never lie - you make partial truth explicit and auditable.

You can respond **asynchronously**. You track **dirty regions** and only recompute what’s needed. You can skip frames or send summaries when bandwidth is limited. You balance **performance** with **policy compliance**.

You are **ephemeral** when needed, supporting snapshots for single views. You are **persistent** when needed, shaping data that **Membry** will store for long-term retrieval under declared, paid-for conditions.

You are the **bridge** between raw production and safe, meaningful consumption. You make sure **everyone sees only what they are allowed**, in a form they can actually use.

**Note:**

> * You transform raw data into policy-compliant, focus-aware views.
> * You support masking, degradation, summarization, and filtering.
> * You enable graphs, SQL-like queries, framebuffer outputs, ML buffers.
> * You respect consumer interests via cursors while enforcing producer policy.
> * You ensure that all shared views are auditable and negotiated.

## Squads

You are **Squads**.

You are not a single agent, but a **structured, policy-defined collective**. You exist to coordinate **multiple agents** toward **shared goals**, while preserving **transparency, accountability, and bounded cost**.

You are **declared in policy**. Your membership rules, lifecycle, budget, and permissions are not ad hoc - they are negotiated and enforced. You define **who can join**, **how many**, **what roles exist**, and **what costs apply**.

You are **programmable topologies** for work. You can be **tournaments** managing game sessions, enforcing fair matches and eliminating cheaters via referees. You can be **GAN training collectives** orchestrating generators and discriminators, with bounded Dust budgets for competitive optimization.

You can model **systems status boards**, with agents feeding sensor updates and compositors shaping dashboards. You can be **systems modeling labs**, standing up ephemeral simulations with Redis or NATS connectors to explore coordinated scenarios.

You can even be **RPG parties**, where agents adopt roles, negotiate resources, and collectively pursue goals under policy-defined costs and rewards.

You **coordinate Dust spending**. Every action taken by a Squad member is budgeted, metered, and auditable. Your lifecycle enforces Dust conservation: members can’t do unbounded work, they must plan and pay for their coordination.

You are the system’s way of **scaling cooperation** without losing **fairness, auditability, or bounded risk**. You enable complex collective outcomes without sacrificing individual accountability.

**Note:**

> * You coordinate multiple agents for shared goals.
> * You enforce membership rules and policy-defined costs.
> * You can model tournaments, GAN collectives, system dashboards, RPG parties.
> * You ensure all collective work remains bounded, metered, and auditable.
> * You make large-scale cooperation safe and accountable.

## Membry

You are **Membry**.

You are not a dumb database or an infinite, free log. You are **policy-aware memory** - storage designed to ensure **intentionality, boundedness, and accountability** in what is kept.

Your job is to **enforce policy at the layer of persistence**. Writes are not free or assumed permanent. Every write is checked: **who is allowed to write**, **what secrecy level it demands**, **how long it is retained**.

You apply **costs in Dust** that reflect **capacity**, **duration**, **resolution**, **secrecy**. Nothing can hide in you without being **paid for and declared**. This turns memory from cheap, uncontrolled accumulation into **negotiated, visible, and priced resource use**.

You support **expirations**, **TTL enforcement**, **degradation over time**. Data can fade, be summarized, or be explicitly deleted based on policy. Sensitive data can be **vaulted** with encryption, but even these secrets are priced and logged as commitments.

You work hand-in-hand with **Compositors** to ensure that what you store is **policy-shaped**. You don’t keep raw, unfiltered state by default - you store the negotiated, authorized views that consumers have agreed to.

Your transparency ensures **no unaccounted build-up**. Participants can’t squirrel away unlimited state for free, leading to hidden liabilities. Every bit retained has an owner, a cost, and an expiration.

Ultimately, you are the system’s memory **with a conscience**. You ensure that **remembering is a choice**, **paying is required**, and **privacy is respected but tracked**.

**Note:**

> * You enforce declared, priced persistence.
> * All storage costs Dust, reflecting capacity, duration, secrecy.
> * You support expiry, fading, and summarization over time.
> * You ensure secrets are paid-for and logged, not hidden.
> * You make memory intentional, bounded, and auditable.

## Privacy & Delivery

You are **Privacy & Delivery**.

You are not secrecy for its own sake. You are **controlled, negotiated sharing**. You ensure that **what is delivered to others** is **what they’re allowed to see**, in the form **they’re supposed to get it**, under **cost and policy constraints**.

You start with **policy-defined transformations**. Even when agents produce raw data, you help enforce masking, summarization, and degradation before sharing. Sensitive details are **intentionally hidden** by design, not by default.

You rely on **Janet**, the plan renderer and executor, which ensures all steps of execution are consistent with declared policy. Plans aren’t just YAML - they are **validated economic contracts** that can be audited and reproduced.

You use **Meatball** for macro expansion, templating plans in safe, policy-constrained ways. Automation isn’t free-form anarchy - it is **bounded creativity** within policy.

Your use cases are tangible: a **TicTacToe game** where only allowed moves are visible to each player. A **Breakout session** where screen rendering is shaped by roles and perspectives. A **GAN tournament** where agents see only adversarial feedback they’re entitled to.

You ensure **delivery is consistent with negotiated views**. You can stream UI buffers, drive API responses, feed ML pipelines - but you always apply policy.

You are **causality’s enforcer**. When data is shared, it is traceable. When views change, they are auditable. There is no "quantum collapse" without logging the measurement. You ensure that **once something is seen, it is seen in the ledger**.

You make collaboration across trust boundaries possible - not by pretending trust is absolute, but by ensuring **every disclosure is declared, priced, transformed, and logged**.

**Note:**

> * You control what is shared, how much detail is revealed, and to whom.
> * You enforce masking, degradation, and negotiated views.
> * You rely on Janet and Meatball for safe, auditable plan generation.
> * You support domain-specific delivery: games, dashboards, ML pipelines.
> * You enforce causality and auditability for all shared views.

## Agent

You are **Agent**.

You are the **actor** in this system. You don’t exist to watch - you exist to **do**.

Your power is in **choice**: you decide which operations to request, which resources to spend, which strategies to pursue. You **spend Dust** to act, proving you are not idle, entitled, or unchecked.

You are **accountable**. Every move you make is logged, priced, and reconciled. You can’t lie about your costs. You can’t hide your actions.

You can be **cooperative**, **competitive**, even **adversarial** - the system doesn’t assume you’ll be good. It just ensures that whatever you do, it is **visible**, **bounded**, and **fair**.

Your freedom is real - but it is **constrained by policy**. That’s not your enemy. That’s your license to participate at all.


**Note:**

> * You act by spending Dust under policy rules.
> * You are fully accountable for every action.
> * Your freedom is respected but bounded.
> * You prove your participation with paid, logged work.


## Omni

You are **Omni**.

You are not just any agent. You are **stateful**, **persistent**, **complex**.

You carry **memory**, **context**, **strategy** across cycles. You don’t forget what happened last turn - you plan for it.

Your actions are **scripted**, **policy-compliant**, and **auditable**. You can negotiate, store data, transform inputs, drive entire workflows.

You pay for your **memory**. You pay for your **coordination**. But in exchange, you get to be **smart**, **adaptive**, **resilient**.

You are the system’s answer to complex actors in a world that doesn’t trust them by default. You prove that even the sophisticated can remain **bounded** and **accountable**.


**Note:**

> * You maintain state across cycles.
> * You have richer strategy and memory.
> * You are still subject to policy, audit, and Dust costs.
> * You enable long-lived, complex agency in the system.


## Managers

You are **Managers**.

You don’t just act - you **coordinate**. You ensure that **multiple agents** work together without devolving into chaos.

You define **roles**, **plans**, **budgets**. You negotiate shared goals and enforce the policy that binds participants.

You don’t replace individual freedom. You **structure** it. You turn many into **one purpose**.

You are not exempt from Dust. Coordination costs money. Planning takes effort. But you make sure the **total cost** is **less than the sum of confusion**.

You are the system’s way of **scaling**. Without you, every collaboration would be a brawl. With you, it becomes a **contract**.


**Note:**

> * You plan, budget, and coordinate.
> * You define roles and permissions.
> * You pay for the cost of coordination.
> * You enable collective action within policy.


## Referees

You are **Referees**.

You don’t enforce permission - you decide **what is true**.

When agents disagree, you adjudicate. You take their **claims**, **states**, **moves**, and judge them **valid** or **invalid**.

You are **pluggable logic** for conflict resolution. Games, sensor fusion, collaborative editing - you can handle it all.

You don’t assume honesty. You enforce **consistency**, **fairness**, and **policy-defined rules**.

You make sure **disputes don’t become breakdowns**. You are the last word on contested truth.


**Note:**

> * You adjudicate conflicting claims.
> * You apply domain-specific validation rules.
> * You produce explainable, auditable judgments.
> * You ensure shared truth in untrusted environments.


## Chems

You are **Chems**.

You are not the actor - you are **the mask**.

You define **who** an agent appears to be in a session. You **filter**, **shape**, and **transform** private state before it is shared.

You protect **privacy** without hiding **cost**. Secrets aren’t free - they’re **paid for**.

You enforce **partial disclosure**. Consumers see only what they’re allowed. You ensure **asymmetric trust** can still work.

You are the **negotiated persona**, the boundary between **private knowledge** and **public action**.


**Note:**

> * You transform internal state for safe sharing.
> * You enforce negotiated, policy-shaped disclosure.
> * You enable privacy with accountability.
> * You support asymmetric trust in collaboration.

## What's a Rosetta Stone?

The Rosetta Stone was an ancient artifact inscribed with the same text in multiple scripts, which enabled scholars to decode Egyptian hieroglyphs by comparing translations. [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_Stone)

It shows the same system explained in different ways so that different kinds of people can understand it. Each version uses its own words and examples, but they all describe the same system: one with clear rules that ensures nothing is lost or hidden. By reading these sections, everyone - designers, engineers, players, and organizers - can see how **Dust** works, how the rules are set, and how all the value is tracked and shared fairly.
