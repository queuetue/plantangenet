# Plantangenet Rosetta Stone Index

Plantangenet: We're making tiny universes.

But these aren’t fantasies you just watch—they’re systems you enter, negotiate, break, and build. Each one has its own rules, its own economy of trust, sabotage, fairness, and hustle. Plantangenet isn’t selling you magic. It’s offering a design for deals you can’t cheat, value you can’t hide, and promises you can’t forget—even when you really want to.

This Rosetta Stone is your gateway. It translates that idea into many languages: for artists, hackers, economists, engineers, trolls. Each “stone” speaks your dialect while showing the same foundation: a ledger you can see, a policy you can argue, a system you can fork. If you’re looking for something to collaborate with, compete in, or blow up and improve, pick your stone and start reading.

These are the [Rosetta Stone](#about-the-rosetta-stone) translations for the Plantangenet system overview. This directory contains multiple perspectives on how the system works, each tailored to a different audience or domain. If you’re new, use this guide to select the stone that best matches your background or interests:

Don't forget the [glossary](./GLOSSARY.md) is available.

## Which Stone Should I Start With?

- **Artist**: For creators, performers, and anyone who values recognition and fairness in collaborative work. [Artist](artist/README.md), [Neutral](neutral/README.md) * SUPPORT LOCAL ARTISTS *
- **Neutral**: The baseline, domain-agnostic explanation. Start here if you want a clear, policy-driven overview suitable for any stakeholder. [Neutral](neutral/README.md) Long and Dry.
- **Economic / Accounting**: For those with a background in finance, accounting, or resource management. Explains Dust as a robust accounting and budgeting system. [Neutral](neutral/README.md), [Economic](economics/README.md)
- **Electrical Engineering / Systems**: For engineers and systems thinkers. Uses circuit and network metaphors to describe conservation, flows, and optimization. I try to speak EE [here](ee/README.md)
- **Quantum**: For physicists, mathematicians, or those interested in uncertainty, measurement, and reconciliation. Uses quantum metaphors for policy and audit. Had fun with this one, apologies.  [Quantum](quantum/README.md)
- **Streamer / Watcher**: For live creators and their audiences. Focuses on transparency, tipping, and fair sharing in interactive sessions. A specific type of artist might want to see my vision of how [Streamers](streamer/README.md) or [Watchers](watcher/README.md) view the system.
- **Infrastructure**: For those who build, maintain, or fund the underlying systems. Highlights visibility, compensation, and sustainability. You might prefer the self-reflection [view](system/README.md) or [Infrastructure](infrastructure/README.md)
- **Hacker**: For programmers, tinkerers, and system architects. Emphasizes hackability, auditability, and optimization. [Please contact me.](hacker/README.md)
- **Thief / Troll**: For critics, disruptors, or those who challenge systems. Explains how Dust makes sabotage visible and invites and challenges adversarial testing. [Thief](thief/README.md), [Troll](trolls/README.md)
- **Self-Reflective / System**: For designers and architects who want a first-principles, internal perspective on Dust itself. [view](system/README.md) or, of course, the source itself.
- **For Bob**: I'm sorry he'll never get to read it, but this one is for my friend, Bob. If you're good at plumbing or electrical work, this might resonate with you. [For Bob](for_bob/README.md) 

Each stone uses its own metaphors and examples, but all describe the same system: one with clear rules, transparent value flows, and policy-driven fairness. Pick the stone that speaks to you, and refer to [GLOSSARY.md](./GLOSSARY.md) as the shared vocabulary as you read.

## Directory Structure

- Each subdirectory contains a README.md for its translation.
- [GLOSSARY.md](./GLOSSARY.md) provides definitions for key terms used throughout the stones.

## About The Rosetta Stone

In 196 BCE, a Greek-Egyptian teenager faced an impossible problem. He was Pharaoh—a kind of Egyptian ruler—but his kingdom was in turmoil: rebellion, foreign threats, immigration tensions, and a deep crisis of legitimacy.

Ptolemy V stood forth and decreed that a translation would be created so that the Greek settlers, the Egyptian priesthood, and the joint administrative classes all agreed on the same laws and interpretation. He enlisted wise priests, bureaucrats, and stone carvers to create a stele—a carved stone marker—to preserve this shared decree forever.

This artifact served in temples and public spaces before being buried, forgotten, and lost near the town of Rashid (Rosetta). Centuries later, it was rediscovered by French officer Pierre-François Bouchard during Napoleon’s Egyptian campaign. The Rosetta Stone became the key that finally unlocked our understanding of Egyptian hieroglyphs—proving the lasting wisdom of a 13-year-old ruler who solved his big problems with a shared, durable translation.

I'm humbly trying to do the same here: to make this space at least intelligible to you, wherever you’re coming from.
