# Troll Translation

This document is part of a Rosetta Stone for understanding the Plantangenet system.

## Dust

Plantangenet’s Dust system is **built to be uncheatable**. It exists so that **no one can drain value without being seen**, and **no one can force others to give for free**.

It’s not here to stop you from **being hostile, sarcastic, competitive, or subversive**. It’s here to make sure **if you want to fight, you pay the ante**.

Dust is **pre-funded**. Every cycle begins with a fixed budget everyone sees. You can’t promise what you don’t have. You can’t extract on credit. You can’t demand more than what was put in.

When you want to act - shout, joke, insult, demand changes, rewrite policy, even *tear down the current leaders* - you **spend** Dust. The system doesn’t ban that. It simply **accounts** for it.

Because Dust is **bounded**, there’s no way to mint more by shouting louder. Your share is all you get to spend. If you burn it on nonsense, that’s your call. But everyone will see you did.

At the end of each cycle, **all Dust is reconciled**. Nothing can hide in backchannels. Everyone knows **who paid**, **who got paid**, **what was said**, and **what was changed**.

## Overthrow Is Easy - Rule Is Hard

Plantangenet is designed so **overthrow is cheap**. You can eject any ruling group.

But you don’t get to replace them with silence.
You don’t get to rule as yourself in the dark.

You have to replace them **immediately**, with **someone willing to show up and demonstrate character**. Maybe that’s you. But you’ll be in the open. You’ll have to entertain. You’ll have to account for what you spend and do. If not, then expect something different.

## For the Clever Troll

You want to outsmart it? Ok, if you have to.  Please try to be polite.

* Find the contradictions.
* Break the accounting.
* Show the policy is bad.
* Make people laugh at us.
* [Here's some ammo.](../../philosophical/THREE_CHEATS.md)

That's ok.

But you’ll pay for the space you occupy, like everyone else. And you can’t hide your sabotage. It’s visible, permanent, part of the ledger, and I hope you help us mop up afterwards.

## For the Honest Enemy

If you don’t believe in it? That’s fine.
If you think it’s dumb? That’s fair.
If you want to compete, mock, or parody it? Welcome.

Just do it **within the rules everyone sees**.
Spend your share. Make your case, Get people to agree, or please walk away.


**Note:**
This system is designed to be resilient, clear, and honest.

> * The total Dust supply is pre-funded and fixed - so your attacks cost you.
> * All transactions are recorded and visible.
> * Overthrow is easy, but ruling requires being seen.
> * You can halt the system, but you can’t hijack it without playing the same game.
> * We don’t stop trolls. We account for them.
> * If you want to help make it better, even as a critic - you can.

## What's a Rosetta Stone?

The Rosetta Stone was an ancient artifact inscribed with the same text in multiple scripts, which enabled scholars to decode Egyptian hieroglyphs by comparing translations. [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_Stone)

This translation is for **you**. It says:
*We see you. We respect your power to disrupt. And we designed for it.*

This is your invitation to test it.
Or ignore it.
But not break it secretly.

Because nothing is hidden here.
Not even you.
