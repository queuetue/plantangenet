# Thief Translation

This document is part of a Rosetta Stone for understanding the Plantangenet system.

## Dust

Plantangenet’s Dust system is **designed to stop easy theft**. Not because we hate thieves. We respect them enough to design with them in mind.

We know you’re smart. We know you see angles most people miss. You see overhead that can be skimmed, corners that can be cut, resources that can be hidden. You see the ways trust can be gamed.

Dust is here to make those angles **not worth it**.

## The Honest Game of Dishonesty

Dust doesn’t assume you’ll behave. It assumes you won’t.

* It assumes people will try to take more than they give.
* It assumes people will try to hide costs.
* It assumes people will lie about what they did.

So it puts everything **on the record**.

You can still be clever here.

* You can still negotiate better deals.
* You can still out-compete others.
* You can even troll the system, sabotage its flow, break it if you want.

But you can’t **steal from it in secret**.

---

## Theft Is Too Much Work Here

Plantangenet’s Dust is **pre-funded**. It means:

* No hidden debts.
* No IOUs you can resell.
* No unpaid labor you can repackage.

All costs are **declared**. All payments are **tracked**. All spending is **audited**.

To steal here means you’d have to do it in plain sight. It’s not impossible. It’s just too expensive to be fun.

## The Invitation: Join the Game

This system doesn’t want to punish you, it wants to **convert you**.

We know your skill.
You see loopholes, friction, waste.
You know how systems fail.
You know how to spot people lying about costs.

We want you **here**, doing that work **for real**.

---

## It’s Better to Help Than Exploit

In Dust, **optimization is rewarded**.

* When you find ways to reduce friction, you keep the savings.
* When you reduce coordination costs, you make more Dust available.
* When you improve workflows, you earn the credit.

The thing you’re so good at--making systems work better by pushing on them--is **paid work** here.

## For the Born Hustler

We know you don’t want to follow rules for the sake of it.

Dust’s rules exist to make the game **fair**.

* So your skill doesn’t just take from suckers, it's recognized by the community.
* So you don’t have to pretend to be nice while you gut the joint.
* So you can compete **in the open**, and win **honestly**.

You can still negotiate the best terms and sell your pitch. You can still hustle.

But you have to show your work.

## For the Reluctant Thief

We know not every thief is cruel.

* Some people steal because systems exclude them.
* Some cheat because it feels fairer than getting screwed.
* Some skim because it’s the only way they see to survive.

We see that. We’re not here to shame you.

Dust is designed to give **a better option**.

* No hidden taxes on your labor.
* No unspoken debts you’ll never be paid for.
* No games where the house always wins.

If you want to join, you can.
No apology required.

Why not try reentering from the [hacker](../hacker/README.md) route?

**Note:**
This system is designed to make theft unappealing, not impossible.

> * All Dust is pre-funded and accounted for.
> * There’s no way to mint value in secret.
> * All spending and giving is tracked.
> * You can hustle--but you’ll do it in the open.
> * Optimization, negotiation, and cleverness are rewarded.
> * Everyone can see if you deliver value or just cost others.
> * If you want to help us break, fix, or improve the system--you’re welcome here.

## What's a Rosetta Stone?

The Rosetta Stone was an ancient artifact inscribed with the same text in multiple scripts, which enabled scholars to decode Egyptian hieroglyphs by comparing translations. (Wikipedia)

This translation is for **you**. It says:
*We see you. We respect you. We built this with you in mind.*

You’re welcome to test it.
To stress it.
To break it--and get paid to help fix it.

Because here, we believe **everyone’s work should be seen and valued. Even yours.**
