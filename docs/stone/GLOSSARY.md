# Plantangenet Rosetta Stone Glossary

Welcome to the Rosetta Stone Glossary for Plantangenet. This is your guide to the functional vocabulary used in the Rosetta Stone translations. Each translation explains the Dust system from a different perspective, using metaphors and language tailored to a specific audience. If youâ€™re new, start by choosing the stone that best matches your background or interests:

---

## Which Stone Should I Start With?

- **Neutral**: The baseline, domain-agnostic explanation. Start here if you want a clear, policy-driven overview suitable for any stakeholder.
- **Economic / Accounting**: For those with a background in finance, accounting, or resource management. Explains Dust as a robust accounting and budgeting system.
- **Electrical Engineering / Systems**: For engineers and systems thinkers. Uses circuit and network metaphors to describe conservation, flows, and optimization.
- **Quantum**: For physicists, mathematicians, or those interested in uncertainty, measurement, and reconciliation. Uses quantum metaphors for policy and audit.
- **Artist**: For creators, performers, and anyone who values recognition and fairness in collaborative work.
- **Streamer / Watcher**: For live creators and their audiences. Focuses on transparency, tipping, and fair sharing in interactive sessions.
- **Infrastructure**: For those who build, maintain, or fund the underlying systems. Highlights visibility, compensation, and sustainability.
- **Hacker**: For programmers, tinkerers, and system architects. Emphasizes hackability, auditability, and optimization.
- **Thief / Troll**: For critics, disruptors, or those who challenge systems. Explains how Dust makes sabotage visible and invites adversarial testing.
- **Self-Reflective / System**: For designers and architects who want a first-principles, internal perspective on Dust itself.

Each stone uses its own metaphors and examples, but all describe the same system: one with clear rules, transparent value flows, and policy-driven fairness. Pick the stone that speaks to you, and use this glossary to decode the vocabulary as you read.
