# Dust

Plantangenet’s Dust system can be understood as a **closed, policy-defined reaction environment** where value behaves like a conserved substance moving through well-specified transformations. Each operational cycle is analogous to a controlled reaction run with a **fixed, pre-measured quantity of reactant**--Dust--which is injected at the start through pre-funding. This sets a strict, known budget for the system, ensuring **mass balance** throughout.

Participants act as **catalysts** or **reactants** within policy-defined **reaction pathways**. Every action or transaction has a **defined reaction mechanism** with specified costs representing *activation energy* or *enthalpy changes*--including coordination, validation, and audit overhead. These costs ensure that reactions cannot proceed uncontrolled, enforcing integrity and security in system interactions.

At the end of the cycle, **all Dust must be accounted for**. Conservation is mandatory: every unit of Dust must be traceable to products (work performed), byproducts (fees and overhead), reserves, or participant holdings. There is no room for unplanned reactions or spontaneous, untracked transformations. Even tips, forfeitures, and drift are **planned reaction products** defined by policy, returning Dust to reserves or shared system resources.

The system’s **policy framework** defines all allowed transformations and costs, ensuring that no energy (value) is lost or created unpredictably. Optimization is encouraged: participants can design more efficient pathways (lower activation energy) that reduce overhead and maximize productive yield. These savings remain in the system, enabling greater value distribution in future cycles.

Ultimately, Dust provides a **chemically rigorous model** for defining and enforcing conservation, transformation rules, and fair redistribution of value in any collaborative system. By treating all value flows as part of an explicit, auditable reaction network, the system maintains both flexibility and trust.

## What's a Rosetta Stone?

The Rosetta Stone was an ancient artifact inscribed with the same text in multiple scripts, which enabled scholars to decode Egyptian hieroglyphs by comparing translations. (Wikipedia)

It shows the same system explained in different ways so that different kinds of people can understand it. Each version uses its own words and examples, but they all describe the same system: one with clear rules that makes sure nothing is lost or hidden. By reading these sections, everyone--designers, engineers, players, and organizers--can see how Dust works, how the rules are set, and how all the money or value is tracked and shared fairly.
