# Economic / Accounting Translation
This document is part of a Rosetta Stone for understanding the Plantangenet system. 

## Dust
Plantangenet’s Dust system defines a **closed, policy-governed unit-of-account framework** designed to ensure **strict conservation of value** in each operational cycle, with complete auditability of all flows. It enforces predictable, transparent, and fair allocation of pre-funded resources among participants.

Each cycle begins with a **pre-funded budget**: participants, institutions, or sponsors commit external value (e.g., fiat or other resources) that converts into Dust at a fixed rate. This defines the **total available supply** of Dust for that cycle, eliminating any possibility of unplanned creation or destruction of value during the cycle.

Participants hold **shares** or other entitlement measures that define how Dust is initially distributed at cycle start. Policy governs these allocation rules to reflect roles, contributions, or negotiated agreements. Spending within the cycle happens through **policy-defined reference frames**, which impose explicit prices on permitted actions. These costs include direct work, coordination overhead, validation, and audit processes - ensuring that every activity’s true cost is measured and accounted for.

At the end of the cycle, **all Dust must be fully reconciled**. Every unit must appear in participant holdings, fees and overhead accounts, work performed, or system reserves. There is no allowance for surplus or deficit outside of policy-defined accounts. Even voluntary redistributions - tips, donations, forfeitures - are policy-governed and tracked, ensuring they act as planned sinks or flows into reserves rather than unaccounted losses.

The system also supports **policy-driven redistribution mechanisms** to address social goals, encourage fairness, or prevent hoarding. These might include forced expirations, drift back to reserves, or incentives for collaborative funding. Such mechanisms are declared in advance and enforce auditable, transparent outcomes.

Optimization is encouraged: participants can reduce effective costs by minimizing coordination overhead or audit complexity. These savings remain within the system, strengthening future budgets or reducing fees, benefiting the community as a whole.

Ultimately, Dust offers a **robust accounting framework** for managing shared resources in cooperative or competitive environments. It requires clear, enforceable policy design for allocation, pricing, redistribution, and audit, ensuring **all value remains conserved, visible, and fairly distributed**.

> **Note:**
> This accounting model is deliberately closed, policy-defined, and fully auditable.
>
> * The total Dust supply per cycle is pre-funded and fixed.
> * All allocation and spending rules are explicitly defined.
> * Conservation is enforced with no untracked losses or creation.
> * Costs include direct work and system overhead.
> * Redistribution mechanisms (tips, drift, expiration) are policy-specified and tracked.
> * Emergent efficiencies must respect conservation and auditability.
> * Audit logs ensure all transactions can be independently verified.

## Profit

In Plantangenet’s Dust system, **profit** is a policy-governed, auditable surplus - net gain - earned by participants who deliver work or services more efficiently than baseline costs, or who provide added value through convenience, quality, or bundled offerings.

Profit is **planned and tracked**. Participants set prices for their work within policy-defined reference frames, which specify permitted operations, price bounds, and redistribution obligations (fees, taxes, community contributions). All pricing, costs, and redistributions are transparent and reconciled.

Every transaction records:

- **Price charged**
- **Actual cost incurred**
- **Resulting profit or loss**

Profit is not an uncontrolled surplus or hidden extraction; it is a visible, policy-compliant outcome. Redistribution mechanisms - tips, donations, fees, shared pools - are declared in advance and fully tracked, supporting fairness and community sustainability.

Optimization is encouraged: reducing overhead or improving efficiency increases net gain, but all flows remain conserved and auditable. The system ensures that profit for one participant is balanced by accounted costs and payments elsewhere, maintaining trust and integrity in the economy.

## Policy

**Policy** in Plantangenet acts like the **accounting charter and operating procedures** for the entire system.

It defines:

* **Who** is authorized to transact.
* **What** actions or services are allowed.
* **How** costs are priced and revenues distributed.
* **Under what conditions** access and spending are approved.

Just as a business cannot book arbitrary revenue or expenses outside its chart of accounts, Plantangenet’s **reference frames** ensure that all permitted operations - and their costs - are **pre-defined, justified, and explicit**.

Policy is **active and enforced** at runtime. Every transaction is checked:

* Does this participant have the right role or permission?
* Is this operation within policy-defined pricing bounds?
* Is the requested action consistent with the budget?

Because policy is **modular**, it can model anything from **simple rate cards** to **dynamic, negotiated pricing schemes**. It enables clear, auditable separation of concerns between:

* **Roles** (who can act)
* **Conditions** (when or how they can act)
* **Statements** (rules for specific actions)

Like sound accounting policy, Plantangenet’s approach ensures **no hidden liabilities** and **no unauthorized expenses** can undermine trust in the system.

**Note:**

> Policy defines and enforces *all* spending rules. It ensures Dust transactions are **authorized, priced, and auditable**, maintaining integrity just like strict accounting controls do in finance.

## Compositors

**Compositors** are the system’s **financial reporting pipelines** - turning raw transactional data into **clear, policy-compliant, stakeholder-specific views**.

They function much like **consolidation and reporting engines** in accounting systems:

* **Transform** messy transactional detail into structured summaries.
* **Degrade** or **mask** sensitive data to respect confidentiality.
* **Filter** for specific roles or reporting contexts.
* **Aggregate** over time, regions, products, or projects.

Examples for financial analogies:

* **Balance sheets** – Aggregate agent holdings, fees, reserves.
* **Income statements** – Show Dust spent versus earned by role or activity.
* **Cash flow** – Track movement of Dust over cycles and between accounts.
* **Segment reporting** – Filter by squad, frame, or session for detailed views.

Like a good accounting system, Compositors enforce **consistency** and **policy compliance**:

* Only paid-for detail is delivered.
* Views respect access rights and secrecy levels.
* Redundant calculations are avoided with **dirty-region tracking**.

Compositors are *pluggable*: you can design custom pipelines for dashboards, reports, audits, or strategic planning - always backed by **auditable, conserved Dust flows**.

**Note:**

> Compositors ensure that all views of Dust spending and allocation are **accurate, policy-shaped, and appropriately scoped** - just like solid financial reporting.


## Expansion

**Expansion** in Plantangenet is the system’s mechanism for issuing **temporary purchasing power or elevated budget authority**, based on **policy-defined commitments** and performance.

It functions much like **credit issuance**, **advance payments**, or **project-specific budget overruns**, but is **explicitly scoped**, **non-inflationary**, and **fully auditable**.

Expansion is governed by:

* **Policy**: Specifies who is eligible, under what conditions, and with what collateral or performance guarantees.
* **Mechanisms**:

  * **Credit** – A bounded Dust allowance to be reconciled or earned back.
  * **Advance** – Front-loaded allocation tied to a future deliverable or role.
  * **Multiplier** – Temporary rate increases for throughput under qualifying conditions (e.g. squad-wide acceleration).
  * **Bias** – Structural preference expressed through pricing shifts or cost offsets.

These mechanisms are **declared at time of grant**, with clear **expiration**, **scope**, and **resolution rules**. All expansion activity is **booked separately**, like a temporary sub-budget or forward liability.

Expansion relies on **expansion primitives**: provable actions such as:

* Completing coursework (preconditions)
* Achieving performance benchmarks (measurable outcomes)
* Receiving delegation from qualified agents or roles (policy-based trust)

At the end of a cycle, all expansion must be **reconciled**:

* Either worked off through action
* Reclaimed as unearned advance
* Converted into permanent allocation (if explicitly permitted)

This ensures that **expanded Dust is never created ex nihilo**, but always offset against system-defined value and backed by **performance or policy trust**.

> **Note:**
>
> * Expansion is modeled as **conditional pre-spending** or **temporary credit**.
> * All grants are **bounded, scoped, and revocable**.
> * Policy defines **terms, ceilings, and resolution logic**.
> * Reconciliation ensures conservation, preventing inflation.
> * Enables productivity **without sacrificing accountability**.

## Responsibilities

**Responsibilities** in Plantangenet function like **role-based authorizations tied to budget impact and fiduciary duties**.

They resemble **signatory privileges**, **budget-holder roles**, or **audit-sensitive operator classes** in conventional accounting systems.

Responsibilities are:

* **Policy-defined**: Only eligible agents may assume them, often through vetting (e.g. training, past performance, nomination).
* **Scoped**: Each Responsibility comes with explicit permissions, spending power, and oversight requirements.
* **Tracked**: Actions taken under Responsibility are logged separately, enabling **audit segmentation**.
* **Revocable**: Non-performance, disuse, or violations trigger policy-defined termination or reallocation.

Examples:

* **Adjudicator**: Authorized to resolve disputes, impacting Dust flows and retroactive judgments.
* **Frame Coordinator**: Manages budget ceilings, allocations, and reconciliation within a frame.
* **Vault Steward**: Oversees long-lived or sensitive records, managing cost exposure of durable storage.
* **Policy Author**: Holds rights to propose or ratify changes to economic and operational logic.

Taking on a Responsibility may **increase agent utility**, **unlock Expansion**, or confer **cost control capabilities**—but comes with **explicit risk**, **audit exposure**, and **operational burden**.

Think of Responsibilities as **roles with budgetary impact**, governance power, and **reputational consequence**.

> **Note:**
>
> * Responsibilities = **budget-impacting permissions** gated by policy.
> * They carry **operational and fiduciary risk**.
> * All actions under a role are **logged for financial and governance audit**.
> * Responsibilities may unlock **expansion or higher authority**, but are **never permanent or unchecked**.

## Squads

**Squads** are the system’s **cost centers and project teams** - organizational units with **budget authority** and **defined scopes of work**.

Like departments in a company:

* Squads are **policy-defined** structures that manage groups of agents.
* They have **allocated Dust budgets** (cost centers) for specific goals.
* They negotiate and pay for **internal and external coordination costs**.
* They ensure outputs meet agreed specifications (deliverables).

**Economic use cases**:

* **Tournaments** – Competitive bidding or contract fulfillment with known cost limits.
* **GAN training** – Allocated budgets for adversarial learning cycles.
* **Systems modeling** – Budgeted simulations with paid coordination.
* **Operational dashboards** – Ongoing monitoring and alerting within defined Dust allocations.
* **RPGs or interactive services** – Budgeted, auditable player sessions with defined economics.

Squads **coordinate internal spending** (messages, validation, storage) and **negotiate externally** (with other squads or global reserves). Their **audit logs** let financial planners trace every unit of Dust:

* Who spent it.
* On what.
* For which outcome.

This makes Squads a **transparent, accountable unit** for planning, budgeting, and optimizing operations - just like well-managed organizational divisions.

**Note:**

> Squads are the *cost centers* of Plantangenet, supporting collaborative or competitive work within bounded, auditable budgets.

## Membry

**Membry** is the system’s **policy-bound ledger of durable records** - it enforces **intentional, priced, and auditable storage**.

Unlike free-form, uncontrolled storage (which invites hidden liabilities), Membry treats **data persistence** like a **declared, priced asset**:

* **Writes** require permission and cost payment.
* **Retention** is declared with explicit durations (TTLs).
* **Reads** can be controlled, degraded, or filtered by access rights.

Think of Membry as **managing depreciation schedules** or **inventory records**:

* Short-term, ephemeral caches (low-cost, high-turnover).
* Long-term archives (high-cost, durable, heavily audited).
* Secret vaults (encrypted, priced for secrecy and duration).

All **storage costs** are accounted for in Dust:

* Capacity consumed.
* Retention duration.
* Access complexity and secrecy level.

**Vaulted storage** supports **confidentiality with accountability**. Even hidden records are logged as commitments in the ledger, ensuring the system knows **what is stored, at what cost**, even if contents remain secret.

This eliminates unplanned accumulation, hoarding, or hidden obligations - just like rigorous accounting for **inventory, assets, and liabilities**.

**Note:**

> Membry ensures *all storage* is declared, priced, and tracked - just like any sound accounting system manages inventory and fixed assets.

## Privacy & Delivery

**Privacy** in Plantangenet is modeled as **controlled disclosure** - not absolute secrecy, but **priced, policy-defined sharing**.

Think of it like **financial disclosures**:

* Stakeholders see **appropriate levels of detail**.
* Sensitive data is **redacted or summarized**.
* Transparency is **enforced for required contexts**, while secrecy is **explicitly paid for**.

**Compositors** act as **financial statement generators**:

* For **TicTacToe**, only moves and outcomes are disclosed - player strategies remain private.
* For **Breakout**, positions and scores are shared while internal physics remain opaque.
* For **system dashboards**, only authorized roles see sensitive operational metrics.

**Delivery** is controlled by **Comdecs** (like secure distribution channels):

* Streaming dashboards to execs.
* Generating audit-ready logs.
* Producing sanitized API responses.

**Janet** is the **plan compiler**, enforcing **policy-defined controls** on what can be built and deployed.

**Meatball** is the **macro engine**, supporting **dynamic plan generation** with safe, auditable templates.

Together, these components ensure that **privacy isn’t an afterthought**, but **a deliberate part of system design**:

* All disclosures are negotiated and priced.
* All deliveries are logged.
* No unauthorized leaks undermine system trust.

**Note:**

> Privacy & Delivery ensure **all shared information is deliberate, priced, and policy-shaped**, maintaining trust and accountability just as strong financial controls protect sensitive business data.

## What's a Rosetta Stone?

The Rosetta Stone was an ancient artifact inscribed with the same text in multiple scripts, which enabled scholars to decode Egyptian hieroglyphs by comparing translations. [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_Stone)

It shows the same system explained in different ways so that different kinds of people can understand it. Each version uses its own words and examples, but they all describe the same system: one with clear rules that makes sure nothing is lost or hidden. By reading these sections, everyone - designers, engineers, players, and organizers - can see how Dust works, how the rules are set, and how all the money or value is tracked and shared fairly.
