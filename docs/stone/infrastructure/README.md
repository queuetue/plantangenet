# Infrastructure Provider Translation

This document is part of a Rosetta Stone for understanding the Plantangenet system.

## Dust

Plantangenet’s Dust system is a **transparent, policy-defined accounting model** that explicitly recognizes the real costs of running the systems that make content and interactions possible. It ensures **every infrastructure cost is visible, priced, and fairly compensated**, with nothing hidden behind platform fees or vague service charges.

At its core, Dust is **pre-funded**. Before any cycle - like a live stream, event, or game session - begins, participants and viewers commit funds that convert into Dust. This **sets a fixed, predictable budget** for the entire cycle, ensuring you know exactly what level of infrastructure demand and payment is coming. No hidden surprises or usage spikes with no funding behind them.

During the cycle, participants **spend** Dust to trigger interactions or services. Each of these actions runs through **policy-defined reference frames** with explicit costs, which include not only creative work but also the underlying **infrastructure** needed to deliver it. This means that hosting, storage, encoding, moderation tools, and network delivery are all **priced in**, negotiated ahead of time, and clearly paid for.

At the end of each cycle, **every unit of Dust is accounted for**. Nothing is lost or siphoned off behind closed doors. You see exactly what share of the budget goes to infrastructure. This visibility means you can prove value to participants, negotiate fairly, and invest with confidence in capacity planning. Even tips or leftover balances are not wasted - they’re allocated by policy to reserves, upgrades, or future cycles that you can help plan for.

The system **supports policy-defined redistribution** that includes infrastructure costs as first-class citizens. No one pretends servers run for free. You get to be part of the pricing conversation, ensuring that essential services are sustainably funded without unfairly burdening creators or viewers.

Plantangenet’s design **encourages optimization**. Efficient infrastructure designs lower coordination overhead and reduce costs for everyone, making the system more attractive and sustainable. Your investment in better tools and services is directly rewarded because participants see the savings and can choose to fund the experience they want.

Ultimately, Dust is a **framework** for defining and enforcing fair, auditable payment for all system participants - including the infrastructure providers who keep everything running. It replaces hidden fees and arbitrary cuts with **clear, policy-driven contracts** so you can be fairly compensated, fully visible, and trusted as an essential part of the ecosystem.

> **Note:**
> This system is deliberately designed for fairness and transparency.
>
> * All funding is pre-committed and visible before usage starts.
> * Infrastructure costs are defined in policy and negotiated openly.
> * Nothing is hidden - every Dust unit is tracked and split as agreed.
> * Costs include real infrastructure services like hosting, storage, and encoding.
> * Tips and leftover funds support planned reserves or upgrades.
> * Efficient designs reduce costs and improve sustainability.
> * Audit logs ensure every flow is visible and verifiable to all stakeholders.

## What's a Rosetta Stone?

The Rosetta Stone was an ancient artifact inscribed with the same text in multiple scripts, which enabled scholars to decode Egyptian hieroglyphs by comparing translations. [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_Stone)

It shows the same system explained in different ways so that different kinds of people can understand it. Each version uses its own words and examples, but they all describe the same system: one with clear rules that makes sure nothing is lost or hidden. By reading these sections, everyone - designers, engineers, players, and organizers - can see how Dust works, how the rules are set, and how all the money or value is tracked and shared fairly.
