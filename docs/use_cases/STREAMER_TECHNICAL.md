# Dust Participation Model: Technical Overview

## How Dust Flows

* Viewers pre-purchase Dust before the stream begins.
* Dust is spent in real time for interactions: stickers, emotes, messages, even extending the show.

## Who Gets Paid

* The streamer receives a share of all Dust spent.
* Infrastructure costs are covered: servers, encoders, bandwidth.
* Platform, agents, artists, and moderators also receive allocations.

## Disposition and Redistribution

* At payout, each participant can choose a **disposition**:

  * Keep their share.
  * Reinvest into future streams (marketing, bonuses).
  * Support other creators or services.
  * Let it default to system-managed redistribution.
* Unclaimed or idle Dust drifts back into the system pool over time for fair redistribution.

## Policy-Driven Lifecycle

* Streams have a base Dust budget ensuring minimum runtime.
* Additional Dust can extend the stream, shaped by viewer participation.
* All distribution and retention policies are transparent and enforce expiration to avoid hoarding.

## Why It Works

* Aligns payment with participation and attention.
* Ensures everyone contributing value gets compensated.
* Supports a sustainable, fair, and accountable ecosystem for creators and providers.
