# Dust for Streamers: Quick Guide

## What is Dust?

* Viewers buy Dust up front like credits.
* They use it to interact live - stickers, emotes, votes.
* You use it to pay for games, videos, or make the stream better.
* It literally pays to keep the stream going.

## Why It Matters for You

* Every Dust purchase funds you **and** the whole stack: servers, encoding, platform fees, artists, directors, plugin devs, mods.
* Everyone gets their share.

## How It Works Live

* Viewers spam stickers and effects with Dust.
* You can spend Dust to clear the screen when it gets too crowded.

## Getting Paid and Giving Back

* At the end of a stream, Dust is split up.
* You decide how much to keep or reinvest - marketing, bonuses, extending the show.
* Viewers set their own 'disposition' - they can tip you, fund artists, or just let the system divide it fairly.

## Make It Last

* Streams have a base time budget.
* Extra Dust in play can extend the show if you want.

**In short:** Dust makes your show interactive, pays your bills, and rewards everyone who helps make it happen.
