# DUST: THE MATERIAL ACCOUNTING UNIT IN PLANTANGENET

## **What is Dust?**

Dust is the standard accounting unit in Plantangenet.

It’s not a currency in the traditional sense. It’s not a crypto token you trade on an exchange.

Instead, think of Dust as **the raw, balanced, auditable budget of material potential** within any Plantangenet timeframe.

It represents **participation** and **work**, tracked in a universal, policy-governed way.

---

## **Why “Dust”?**

We call it *Dust* because:

* It’s abundant.
* It’s undifferentiated raw material.
* It’s the substrate from which anything else can be built.
* It’s designed to be cheap, plentiful, and non-scarce in itself.

Dust is the *stuff* of systems—what you use to mint resources, actions, contracts, or entitlements inside a bounded context (a *timeframe*).

---

## **How Dust Compares to Fiat and Crypto**

### ❌ *Not Fiat Currency*

* Dust isn’t centrally issued money you spend at stores.
* There’s no central bank controlling interest rates.
* It’s not meant to accumulate as private wealth.

Fiat currency is designed to move value between people in an open economy. Dust is designed to **account for work and participation** *inside a specific timeframe*.

---

### ❌ *Not Cryptocurrency*

* Dust has no global ledger or blockchain.
* It’s not scarce by design.
* It can’t be traded or speculated on outside its timeframe without policy-governed reconciliation.

Cryptocurrencies often use artificial scarcity and global consensus to enforce value. Dust relies on **declared policy, transparent work receipts, and bounded accounting** to preserve fairness.

---

### ✅ *Work Credits and Material Budget*

If you want an analogy, Dust is closest to *work credits* or a *material budget*.

It’s how the system accounts for **what went in** (labor, computation, participation) and **what comes out** (resources, capacity, coordination).

---

## **How is Dust Minted?**

Dust isn’t “free” or infinite. It’s *minted*, but not arbitrarily, it's converted from real-world value, imported at a known amount as feedstock for plantangenet.  The conversion rate is maintained to represent the real-world costs of maintaining the timeframe, and this rate is fixed for export in a later phase.

* Frames declare **policy**: what work earns Dust, who can mint it, under what rules.
* Participants or sponsors may commit funding or value up front.
* Machines, agents, or people **earn Dust** by performing defined, auditable work.
* All minting is **declared, bounded, and policy-enforced**.

Think of it like *agriculture*:

> *Wheat is minted too. Fields are planted. Inputs are committed. Harvest is tracked.*

Dust is the *crop* of capital and work and participation.

---

## **How is Dust Spent?**

Dust is **spent** to:

* Unlock capacity (like compute, storage, bandwidth).
* Mint resources or items (coal, granite, chemical precursors) "in simulation".
* Coordinate actions among distributed peers.
* Pay for participation in simulations, experiments, games, or federated services.
* Exported back into real-world capital in exchange for work done or value delivered.

Frames define **conversion factors**: how much Dust something costs to create or transform.

---

## **Conversion Example: Games and Simulations**

Imagine a mining game:

* Coal block costs 200 Dust to mint.
* Granite block costs 150 Dust.
* Dust itself may never be visible to players—it’s just the budget the designer used.

Now imagine a chemistry simulator:

* Coal can be broken down to carbon (with loss or cost).
* Carbon can be recombined into calcium carbonate.
* All of these transformations use **Dust accounting** under declared policies.

Different timeframes may expose Dust differently:
✅ In one game, it’s invisible.
✅ In another, it’s a resource you manage carefully.
✅ In a third, it’s surfaced as “action credits” for buying services.

---

## **Inter-Frame Conversion**

Dust is designed to be **timeframe-scoped**:
✅ Inside a timeframe, it’s governed by that timeframe’s policy.
✅ It can’t just move freely between timeframes without reconciliation.

But export is possible *in bulk unprocessed form*.

> *“You want your cash early? Fine. We’ll ship you a pallet of raw universe, and you can refine it.”*

✅ Exported Dust loses high-resolution provenance.
✅ Receivers must process it under their own policy.
✅ This prevents laundering or unbounded extraction.

---

## **Redemption and the “Open Barn Door”**

Frames have **redemption windows**:

* After work is done, before closure, participants can **redeem** Dust for value (money, services, donations).
* This is public. All redemptions are logged and auditable.
* Unclaimed Dust doesn’t accumulate forever.

When the timeframe closes:
✅ Unclaimed surplus is disposed of by declared policy, or agent disposition.
✅ Operator margin, redistribution, donations, or burning.

> *“You can take your share while the barn door is open. When it closes, what’s left feeds the farm, the workers, or the soil.”*

This enforces **bounded, accountable economic cycles**.

---

## **Expected Breakage: Funding the Commons**

Plantangenet **anticipates** that many small participants will:
✅ Earn small amounts of Dust.
✅ Never bother redeeming.

This “breakage” isn’t theft. It’s part of the funding model.

✅ Surplus Dust funds operators.
✅ Supports infrastructure.
✅ Can be redistributed to active contributors.
✅ Or simply burned to control inflation.

All disposition is **declared and auditable**.

---

## **Transparency and Social Accountability**

All redemption events are **public**:

✅ Who redeemed.
✅ How much.
✅ When.

This enables:
✅ Community policing.
✅ Trust.
✅ Clear records of how work was compensated.

Frames are designed to *hold up under audit*.

---

## **Everyday Use: You Might Never See Dust**

For most participants, **Dust is invisible**.

✅ You mine resources.
✅ You perform actions.
✅ You contribute to simulations.

You don’t see your Dust balance unless:
✅ You’re redeeming.
✅ You’re a coordinator managing resources.
✅ You’re a “gig worker” billing for services.
✅ You’re running a carrier moving results between timeframes.

Dust is tracked enough to ensure **fairness**, but **no more than necessary**.

---

## **Why It Matters**

Dust exists to solve real problems in shared systems:

✅ How do you fairly account for work?
✅ How do you prevent extraction or laundering?
✅ How do you avoid coercing people into infinite memory or persistent balances?
✅ How do you design ephemeral, policy-bound economic cycles?

Dust provides:
✔ Auditable participation accounting.
✔ Policy-governed issuance and redemption.
✔ Transparency for community trust.
✔ Bounded economic scope.
✔ Support for redistributive, cooperative models.

---

## **Conclusion**

Dust is not money.
Dust is not crypto.
Dust is not a universal ledger of wealth.

Dust is **a policy-enforced, auditable material budget** for shared timeframes of work, participation, and creation.

It’s designed to be:
✅ Cheap.
✅ Abundant.
✅ Non-hoardable.
✅ Redeemable only with transparency.
✅ Redistributable by policy.
✅ Expirable to avoid accumulation.

It’s how Plantangenet enables **collaboration with dignity**.
It’s how we **bound value** in time, space, and policy.
It’s how we let things **expire gracefully** instead of lasting forever in ledgers no one can amend.
